Some of the projects we’ll eventually work towards will involve some heavy development work, but this is where City’s epic alumni network will come in. Your experience and aptitude as a journalist is what will make this group special. For non-journalists, your outside experience will greatly aid our discussion. If you do program, your technical expertise will be helpful in moving ideas forward. <strong>Everyone is welcome, regardless of technical knowledge.</strong></li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Is this a big time commitment?</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>It doesn’t need to be. This group is designed to allow a broad spectrum of participation — everything from contributing ideas and discussion to hacking code. MA programmes are really labour-intensive; commit at a level you’re comfortable with.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Is this just a bunch of stuff about WordPress?</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>It won’t be. Some focus on WordPress is natural given how widely used it is in our programme and the ease with which it can be extended. However, while WordPress is great for some purposes, it really isn’t the future of online journalism — it’s a blogging platform. If you find WordPress terribly uninteresting, please say so!
