However, I have revived it, on brand spanking new hardway and several major iterations of Minecraft later! Not only that, but it’s running the bad-assery that is Tekkit Lite, which means you can do crazy things like build automated mining robots, write simple computer programs <strong>in-game</strong>, harness the power of volcanoes, <strong><em>even create whole new dimensions via books like in Myst.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Seriously, I have no idea why it took me so long to get on top of Tekkit. That shiz’s cray. </p>\n<p>Because there’s not much in terms of anti-griefing code on the server right now, it’s invitation-only.
