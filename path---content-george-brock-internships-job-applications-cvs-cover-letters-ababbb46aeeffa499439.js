Often no more than a glance.</li>\n<li>Filter 2: night editor. Also a quick look: what a story is, what its projection possibilities are, etc.</li>\n<li>Filter 3: sub editor.

Sometimes simply studying somebody who excels at their job is more instructive than trying to get pieces into the paper. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Go to conferences if possible</li>\n<li>\n<p>Don’t disdain desks in out of the way places.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you want to improve your writing, you’ll get more practice and watch more editors if you go to a less prominent, less glamourous desk — i.e., obituaries. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Obvious but important: read the output of the place you’re working at, and especially before you even get there</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>CVs</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Don’t do more than 2 pages.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you can’t get your life in your early 20s in under 2 pages, you’re not going to convince someone you’re good at distilling information</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Watch for spelling and grammar errors. Even the smallest errors will get your resume binned.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>“It is never possible for a single individual to check their own work perfectly — give it to somebody else.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Carelessness has extremely high cost” — your application is the first contact your organization will have with your writing.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cover letters</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>It’s a courtesy; keep it brief</li>\n<li>Briefly say what sets you apart</li>\n<li>Mention why you want to work at that specific paper; establish your connection to that place.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What employers look for:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Intellectual originality</li>\n<li>Passion</li>\n<li>Good degrees</li>\n<li>Determination</li>\n<li>Make the most of what’s interesting about you</li>\n<li>If you miss a graduate internship by a close distance, remember that most people who made it to the interview round still became successful journalists. </li>\n<li>\n<p>Finally — remember these are organizations aiming for large audiences; don’t overplay blogging.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Show you can write stories for several hundred thousand people, not nine people.
