Hallo (2000)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wedding between Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas. Had sold rights to Ok magazine; rival Hallo had photographer who surreptitiously took photos as part of wedding party. Douglases sued for breach of confidence; court upheld the right of the Douglases to protect their wedding. Court argued law of privacy would uphold law of confidentiality; duty of confidentiality didn’t need to be identified. Setting was private, info had a commercial value — injunction would be granted.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Theakston v. MGN Ltd (2002): photographs</p>\n<ul>\n<li>TV star visited brothel; story was told about exploits. Injunction sought, not granted about an account of what happened, though injunction granted against photographs being published.</li>\n<li>“Photographs can be particularly intrusive, particularly if not done with consent.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Peck v. UK (2003): privacy in a public place</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Person tried to commit suicide, picture being prevented given to media, ECHR came down on his side and the council had acted inappropriately in providing photos to media.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Princess Caroline von Hannover v. Germany (2004)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Argued pictures taken of her were not of public interest and she was being harassed. ECHR came down on Princess Caroline von Hannover’s side.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Naomi Campbell v. MGN Ltd (2004) (<strong>the</strong> major case re: privacy)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Campbell sued over report in Daily Mirror talking about her treatments for drug addiction. Report showed a photo of her leaving therapy session and gave details about therapy; frequency of therapy. Went to House of Lords, which came down 3-2 in favour of Campbell saying it was acceptable to publish details of drug treatment and to say she had a drug problem, but not acceptable to say she was going to Narcotics Anonymous, or where the treatment, or the kind of treatment; also, unacceptable to show photos of her leaving Narcotics Anonymous. Termed “Wrongful disclosure of private information”. Looks at the following:\na. Is it private information?\nb. If disclosure took place, would it cause substantial offence to a reasonable person?\nc. What are the benefits of disclosure?\nd. Where does the public interest lie?</li>\n<li>Lady Justice Hale: distinction being made between coming out from treatment or going about their normal business.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>McKennitt v. Ash (2005)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brought privacy to another level; a Canadian singer (Lorraine McKennitt) had book written about her by friend. Discussed things only a friend would be aware of. </li>\n<li>Court sided with McKennitt; argued she was entitled to protect this information and friend didn’t have right to publish it. In judgement itself, not made clear what was true or not; court said it wasn’t for the claimant to sift through information to discriminate against what is true or not as that would undermine privacy further.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Murray v. Big Pictures (2008)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>JK Rowling followed around Edinburgh with child in a pram; injunction sought to prevent photographs to pursue her.</li>\n<li>Court granted, arguing special protection granted to children.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Max Mosley v. News Group Newspapers Ltd (2008)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sued over NOTW articles suggesting he had been involved in Nazi-themed sex parties.</li>\n<li>Judge came down arguing on the facts that there wasn’t evidence the party was Nazi themed. If it was, there would be public interest.</li>\n<li>Mosley then argued to the ECHR he should be aware of articles coming out about him, but ECHR argued he didn’t have a right to be able to step in an attempt to stop publication. No right for claimant to be told about matter relating to privacy prior to publication.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>LNS v. Persons Unknown (2010)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Footballer (John Terry) tried to create a blanket injunction about an affair. Came down against Terry, arguing he was doing this only to protect commercial interests.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Super injunctions</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Trafigura v. Guardian Newspapers</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Guardian had info re: Trafigura’s toxic waste. Court imposed injunction on publication, but also on publication of information about injunction.</li>\n<li>MP argued there shouldn’t be a superinjunction; injunction unraveled and information because public.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ferdinand v. MGN Ltd (2011)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Rio brought a case against Mirror; Mirror had published details about an affair. Judge Nichol came down on side of newspaper.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ferdinand was the head of English football team; had tried to establish reputation as a reformed character (even having written an autobiography); lady had a right to tell story.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Spelman v. Express Newspapers Ltd</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Newspaper got paper about rugby player (son of MP) had been ordering illegal performance enhancing drugs. Injunction initially granted then revoked; argued info was in the public domain.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Princess Caroline von Hannover (2012)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Case showed her and her family walking through the streets of Monaco with father, Prince Rainier, who had been ill. Law came down on side of press, arguing showing a reigning monarch in recovery was in the public interest.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Human Rights Act §12(3)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No injunction should be granted unless applicant is likely to win its case.</li>\n<li>Media has to be given notice of applicantions</li>\n<li>Much lower test than in libel (I.e., Bonnard v. Perryman), where it would be granted only if applicant is able to establish the falsity of the claims.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>The Right to Life</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Article 2 — Everyone’s right to life should be protected by law. Everyone’s life should be protected by the law, except in the case of capital punishment.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An absolute right; not a qualified right in the sense it isn’t balanced with another right. “Trumps all.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Venables and Thompson v. News Group Newspapers Ltd (2001)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Two youths found guilty in murder of a young boy. Question was if identifiable after release; court was asked to prevent injunction after they reach age of majority in order to protect right to life. Courts came down in favour of individuals; Art. 2 allowed courts to grant injunction preventing identification ever. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Maxine Carr v. News Group Newspapers Ltd (2004)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Involved with a murder case in that she gave a false alibi for her boyfriend. Was granted injunction to prevent her from being identified given she was being sent death threats.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>",frontmatter:{title:"Media Law lecture -- Confidentiality and Privacy pt. 3",date:"March 12, 2012"}}},pathContext:{path:"content/media-law-lecture-confidentiality-and-privacy-pt-3"}}}});
