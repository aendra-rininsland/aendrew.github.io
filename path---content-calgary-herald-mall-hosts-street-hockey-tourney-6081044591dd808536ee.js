With 431 teams registered, the nearly 40 rinks at the Deerfoot Mall will hold almost 1,300 games. Started in 2002, the Calgary event is joined by 17 other cities, making it Canada’s largest sports festival.</p>\n<p>“It’s a little bit of a smaller rink; ob-viously less players,” said Gerhardt. “We actually see a lot of players who come here who don’t have ice hockey skills -you don’t need to necessarily know how to skate in order to play this game.”</p>\n<p>At 11: 45 a.m. today, Calgary Flames assistant coach Dave Lowry, Calgary Hitmen Nathan MacMaster and Brendan Santini, Hitmen alumnus Brandon Kozun and both University of Calgary Dinos teams will play a celebrity game.</p>\n<p>(c) Calgary Herald.
