Nothing to lie awake about; no problems.”</p>\n<p>Shortly into the scan, however, then-first year ultrasound program student Jill Schwarzenberger noticed a six-centimetre bulge in Watson’s aortic artery.</p>\n<p>After informing the instructor, Watson was told to check with his family physician, who then confirmed the presence of the life-threatening aneurysm.</p>\n<p>“It’s like having an old heater hose on a car swelling up in one spot and getting bigger and bigger,” said Watson. “If I hadn’t gone in to get it done, I probably wouldn’t be standing here talking to you.”</p>\n<p>Watson was recently back at SAIT on the one-year anniversary of the screening to express his gratitude.</p>\n<p>For Schwarzenberger, who will graduate from the ultrasound program in December, it was exciting to have an opportunity to make a difference in somebody’s health so early into her career.</p>\n<p>“It’s very rewarding knowing that’s going to be my job later on down the road, and knowing that I potentially helped save somebody’s life. Aortic aneurysm is very deadly,” she said.</p>\n<p>“To be perfectly honest, I’d thought I’d done something wrong at the beginning; I didn’t actually believe it was real.</p>\n<p>“Once I’d gone over it a few times and realized it was real, I got Carrie to come over and explain to me what was going on.”</p>\n<p>Diagnostic medical sonography instructor Carrie Hopkins said abdominal aortic aneurysms afflict about 15 per cent of the population and are difficult to detect due to the lack of symptoms.</p>\n<p>If such an aneurysm ruptures, the results are often fatal.</p>\n<p>“They’re not completely rare, but the more we’re doing screening and scanning, the more we’re seeing them and being able to repair them so they don’t become a lethal situation where (the patient) doesn’t survive the surgery,” Hopkins said.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Watkins has become a staunch advocate for early screening and detection, particularly for men over the age of 50.</p>\n<p>“Just because you feel good doesn’t mean you are good -I’ve always felt healthy,” he said. “Male or female over 50 years of age -talk to your doctor.</p>\n<p>“You should get one of these,” he added.</p>\n<p>© Copyright (c) The Calgary Herald.
