Calgary Herald’s ninth annual Calgary Book Drive and Sale starts Friday.</p>\\n<p>“We’re starting to set up for the sale. It’s going pretty well, we’ve got a lot of volunteers,” said book drive and sale co-ordinator Andria Brumwell.</p>\\n<p>“I don’t know yet (how many books were collected in total), but it’s more than last year.”</p>\\n<p>Recent interesting finds include a book potentially signed by Sir Winston Churchill.</p>\\n<p>“The book itself is called Volume 2: Their Finest Hour from a series of volumes on the Second World War,” said special books manager Gerry Morgan.</p>\\n<p>“The signature is definitely handwritten, it’s not printed, and I’m going to check it with a signature I’ve found online this evening.”</p>\\n<p>Only days away, the sale is set to take place in the big tent at the Crossroads Market on June 10 to 12 and June 17 to 19, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily.</p>\\n<p>Contributions from the sale will go to Calgary’s Servants Anonymous Society, which provides support and services for victims of sexual exploitation, and Postmedia’s Raise-a-Reader program, which aids groups promoting family literacy.</p>\\n<p>With a colossal array of titles across all genres of books, Brumwell anticipates it will be busy.</p>\\n<p>“I think people will start lining up around 7 or 8 a.m., depending what the weather does,” said Brumwell.</p>\\n<p>She adds, however, that bargain hunters don’t have to endure the elements hours before the sale opens to come across good finds -with 10 trailers of sorted books refreshed each night over the course of the six sale days, both dedicated and casual book lovers should be able to find a stack of summer reading.</p>\\n<p>“I know a lot of people think that if they don’t come on the first day, everything will be picked over, but that’s not true,” she said. “We’ve got so many in reserve that we put new stuff out all the time.</p>\\n<p>“They can find anything they’re looking for,” added Brumwell.</p>\\n<p>According to sixth-year volunteer Frieda Aldcroft, it’s the books and the people that keep her coming back to help, year after year.</p>\\n<p>“Everybody that works here loves books and loves to read. You can tell by the number of books we all buy during the start!” said Aldcroft.</p>\\n<p>“It’s a very nice camaraderie, especially since we don’t see each other except at the book sale -you look forward to it.</p>\\n<p>“It’s just a nice atmosphere to work in and it’s for charity. It makes you feel good inside.”</p>\\n<p>Fourth-year volunteer Pierrette Lavallee-Hoch agrees.</p>\\n<p>“From May until June, it’s what we do three days a week,” she said.</p>\\n<p>“There’s every genre of book, for every age of people, and we do resort between the two weekends so there are always new books.”</p>\\n<p>Calgary Book Drive &#x26; Sale supported by the Calgary Herald</p>\\n<p>First weekend sale dates: Today, Saturday and Sunday</p>\\n<p>Second weekend sales dates: June 17, June 18 and June 19</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Times: 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Admission: $2, children 12 &#x26; under are free</p>\\n<p>Location: Crossroads Market (at the junction of Blackfoot Trail and Ogden Road S.E.)</p>\\n<p>All proceeds go to Servants Anonymous and the Calgary Herald’s Raise-a-Reader program</p>\\n<p>© Copyright (c) The Calgary Herald.

All the projects I do with Citizen Media are hosted on Dreamhost, because their DreamPress managed hosting is really tight — ~$20 per month for managed WordPress hosting. While it’s not nearly as “managed” as, say, WordPress VIP, I effectively never have to worry about server performance for any site hosted as such. The main <a href=\\\"http://www.hackneycitizen.co.uk\\\">Hackney Citizen</a> site is hosted as such now, and as traffic for <a href=\\\"http://www.eastendreview.co.uk\\\">other</a> <a href=\\\"http://www.bestofhackney.com\\\">Citizen-related</a> <a href=\\\"http://www.eastendcitizen.co.uk\\\">projects</a> ramps up, they can be easily migrated there.</p>\\n<p>So, tl;dr — if all you’re doing is running WordPress, Dreamhost is still a’ight.</p>\\n<p><html><head></head><body><strong></strong></body></html>Update:<html><head></head><body></body></html> After a solid year of nothing but absolutely shit service from Dreamhost across multiple accounts, this blog post is no longer true. I’ll write an actual post about my experiences soon, but for the moment — do yourself a favour and steer clear of Dreamhost.</p>\\n<p>(Also, if anyone has any webhost suggestions, I’m all ears — please post in the comments, thanks!)</p>\\n<p>Web hosting is always one of those awkward things you have to deal with when building new websites — if the client already has some sort of online presence, they probably have a preexisting business relationship with whoever is hosting their current website, even if that’s just a placeholder page. In general, the larger the existing web presence, the more difficult it is to make a client let go of their existing host. In the case of simple, HTML-driven websites, this isn’t much of a problem. However, in order to provide a consistent and high quality experience to your visitors, it is absolutely critical to select a high quality webhost if using a server-driven Content Management System (CMS) framework like <a href=\\\"http://wordpress.org\\\">WordPress</a>, <a href=\\\"http://joomla.org\\\">Joomla!</a> or <a href=\\\"http://drupal.org\\\">Drupal</a>.</p>\\n<p>Note that this may differ from your domain registrar. While some companies like <a href=\\\"http://godaddy.com\\\">GoDaddy</a> use really obnoxious checkout procedures as a way to sucker people into using their mediocre hosting service, often one works with two separate companies, one of which is dealt with once a year (the domain registrar — i.e., at renewal time) while the other entails daily interaction (the webhost). At its most basic level, a CMS is a big collection of server scripts that build a webpage when a user loads it. Say a visitor to your website loads the front page — a bunch of code sends the headers, a bunch more gathers data about whether the user is logged in or not, some more looks up the content that’s supposed to be displayed on that particular page, other code renders the layout and design elements, et cetera. While this doesn’t necessarily happen every single time a user loads a page — after generating a page, the CMS keeps a copy of it to keep processing overhead down — it happens often enough that server-related issues can push load times past the often-fatal 5 second mark (after which most users will supposedly give up patience).</p>\\n<p>I have administrated web servers since I was in high school and, trust me, it is both an art and a science. I have also dealt with so many absolutely terrible webhosts that have ultimately cost me money in terms of lost time due to being improperly or poorly configured that it would make your head spin. Because of this, the only company I trust with hosting my work is <a href=\\\"http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?329024\\\">Dreamhost</a>.</p>\\n<h1>Here is why:</h1>\\n<h2>It’s cheaper than everyone else</h2>\\n<p>Just to get it out of the way, using Dreamhost will save you money. I don’t know what your current webhost charges you, but it’s likely much more than what a comparable plan through Dreamhost will set you back. Their <a href=\\\"http://www.dreamhost.com/hosting.html\\\">hosting plan</a> has only one package/tier/plan/program and will supply you with all the space, bandwidth, users, emails, databases and domains you could ever ask for. Between all my projects, I’m currently hosting 50 domains on a single shared hosting account. While Dreamhost has a <a href=\\\"http://www.dreamhost.com/hosting-vps.html\\\">Virtual Private Server</a> service, you’ll only ever need it if you’re serving something that is incredibly memory- or CPU-intensive.</p>\\n<h2>It’s like totally sweet</h2>\\n<p>Unlimited space. Unlimited email. Unlimited bandwidth. Unlimited domains. Unlimited emails. Unlimited databases. Unlimited announcement and discussion lists. Support for everything under the sun. Easily restore automatically-kept file and database backups with two clicks. And this is just the basic webhosting plan.</p>\\n<h2>They give you a legit amount of RAM</h2>\\n<p>A modern CMS will use quite a bit of RAM — I’ve seen WordPress and Drupal consume upwards of 50mb per page request with enough plugins/modules. That big chain of scripts that I talked about at the beginning? When it happens, there’s a spike in memory usage as the CMS churns through all those functions linked together. If you have a lame webhost that limits your memory usage to something ridiculous like 24mb per process and you’re running against your memory limit, one of those functions will tell the next in the chain to fire but it will run out of memory and instead return a 500 internal service error message. This will render one of two ways: either as an ugly blank screen with a bunch of useless information on it, or an ugly blank screen with nothing on it. Neither makes your visitors think you’re a very competent company (Best case scenario is that the server delivers a cached version of the page). The 80mb allocated by Dreamhost is generally more than enough for most PHP-based CMS systems (Drupal, WordPress, Joomla!); if not, you can scale to their Virtual Private Server plans relatively easily. </p>\\n<h2>Industry-leading tech support</h2>\\n<p>The world would be a beautiful place if only everyone was as helpful as Dreamhost’s support staff is. I have dealt with an incredibly wide range of support personnel in my lifetime, and I will say without hesitation that Dreamhost’s are the fastest, friendliest and most helpful I have ever encountered. When the shit hits the fan, these are the people that might be the difference between your site being down for five minutes or for five hours. This is not true for all webhosts — some I’ve dealt with seem to have a total of one support staff, who’s more accustomed to static HTML pages than these newfangled PHP script thingamawhatsit, and take not mere hours but whole <em>weeks</em> to respond. In addition, they have a lot excellent official and community-supported documentation, detailing everything from configuring your email client to installing a custom PHP.ini file.</p>\\n<h2>100% Uptime Guarantee</h2>\\n<p>If you notice your site’s down due to problems on Dreamhost’s behalf, <a href=\\\"http://www.dreamhost.com/hosting-100-percent-uptime-guarantee.html\\\">they’ll give you a day of free hosting for each hour</a> (or fraction thereof) your account is inaccessible (upon opening the support ticket). Given Dreamhost is pretty inexpensive to begin with, this means a day of downtime (and lost work if your company uses web-based systems through its website) will save you roughly $7 in hosting. However, my experience has been that downtime is fairly rare with Dreamhost and is often fixed by the time I send the support ticket (On that note, if anybody knows of some comparative data analyzing downtime between large webhosts, I’d be very interested).</p>\\n<h2>Great newsletters</h2>\\n<p>I’m really adverse to promotional materials; my inbox is cluttered with an astounding array of things I’ve subscribed to but don’t ever actually read.

I’ve been in London almost two days now, having arrived at around 2:00 p.m. on the 15th. My flight was fantastic — never before have I gotten an extra seat to myself on a transcontinental flight — and I was able to get enough sleep to not be totally comatose the first afternoon. Quite a good thing, that; lugging the entirety of your accumulated worldly possessions (in the form of two 50-pound suitcases) through the heart of London is not a task for the faint of heart. Initially I was going to take the Piccadilly Line somewhere, transfer to the Jubilee Line, and then get off at my destination station. Instead, with Jubilee Line closed south of Baker Street Station, I had to transfer to another line and then on to Jubilee, finally arriving at my terminating station at around 5:15 p.m. Even Baker Street was closed for a few minutes, throwing me into quite a state of confusion, given Baker Street was where I was told to go at the first closed station. A few minutes and some frantic pacing later, however, the Jubilee Line opened and I was on my way.</p>\\n<p>I have fairly mixed feelings about the hostel I’m staying at — on one hand, the area around it is fairly nice and there a quite a few really decent pubs within walking distance. Food and whatnot seems a bit cheaper in Brent than it does in Islington, and there’s a ton of interesting foreign food close to Kilburn Station. One of the interesting places is the Westbury, where I spent a bunch of time last night (more on that later). Other than that, the hostel’s pretty unremarkable. I’m in the first room by the entrance, which means there’s a constant flux of noise coming from the heavily-hinged doors slamming after people enter (not to mention the assholes who decided it’d be a great idea to have a long, loud conversation outside my door at 7 a.m. today). Combining that with semi-functional Internet, in addition to the fact it’s about 45 minutes from where I’m studying, means I’ll probably try to find somewhere else once my stay ends this coming Wednesday.</p>\\n<p>Hostel griping aside, I’m having a pretty decent time so far. On my first night, I went to a pub and used their free wifi to do some work and send some emails, can’t remember the name at the moment but will update this post once I do (It’s one door down from the Westbury, at any rate). Quite a nice pub, with decent prices and friendly staff. Last night, however, I decided I wanted to listen to some live music before school starts and I’m too busy to do anything interesting. While I initially planned on checking out the legendary Fabric, I figured going to an after-hours club a 45-minute night bus away from where I’m staying was a bad idea, what with real estate appointments at 11 in the morning. As such, I started to look for places within walking distance. </p>\\n<p>One of such places was the Westbury, what seems like an old pub turned into a pretty trendy club. Not much for beer — the bottled fair is limited to a fairly mediocre selection of import beers that includes Sol, Heineken and a few others. Moreover, it’s certainly a place to drink cocktails — while I limited myself to Gin and Tonics, it seemed like they make a decent Mojito, with lots of mint leaves. Divided into a main area with a dance floor and a quieter antechamber containing another smaller bar, the place was moderately busy when I arrived around 10:30 and was packed when I left around 1:30. Although I was really hoping for some drum’n’bass or dubstep, the DJs were decidedly competent and had the crowd moving the entire time with a combination of hip-hop and r&#x26;b, with the occasional foray into house. It was certainly bustling, with a nice mixture of people. A single Gin and Tonic set me back £4.30, with the bottled beer somewhere around £3.90; from my reading, that’s pretty typical pricing for the London club scene.</p>\\n<p>Anyhoo, more later.</p>\\n<p>-æ.</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Night at the Westbury\",\"date\":\"September 18, 2011\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"path\":\"content/night-westbury\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/content-night-westbury.json\n// module id = 521\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"aendrew.com v8\",\"author\":\"Aendrew Rininsland\"}},\"markdownRemark\":{\"id\":\"/Users/andrew.rininsland/Projects/OTHER/aendrew.github.io/src/pages/2011-10-03-media-law-lecture-court-structure/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"html\":\"<h2>Interesting topics:</h2>\\n<p>Photography in court — in Britain, court sketches only; must be done from memory outside of court.

Particularly interesting is Patrick Cain’s “Remembering Toronto’s Fallen from World War II” project, which used a civic data collection project from WWII to visualize the impact of war on a community. Essentially, Toronto City Hall used newspaper ads and casualty lists to create a record for each serviceman from Toronto killed during the conflict — a record currently comprising 12 boxes in the city’s archives. The index cards on which this data was written also listed the address of the deceased’s next-of-kin, from which Cain has built his map. </p>\\n<p>My one criticism with the interactive map is that the poppies don’t really scale properly at the lower zoom levels, to such a point it looks like one big glob when zoomed to its extents.

Now that it’s the start of 2012, and with no more additions to this list, I figure now’s a good time to finally finish and post it.</p>\\n<p>Without further ado:</p>\\n<p>First of all, thank you to my amazing and wonderful girlfriend Siyuan, without whom I would never have thought I’m capable of doing what I’m about to do. In addition to being my guiding light in terms of moving to the UK, she was also the driving force behind my quitting smoking, and is the love of my life. Babe, you’re awesome.</p>\\n<p>Secondly and somewhat obviously, thank you to my parents, who’ve put up with all my idiosyncrasies and bad behaviour this last half decade. Thank you for understanding why I do what I do, and for all the help moving. Thanks also to my sister, who has sat through more political discussions between my parents and I than any sibling should have to endure, and who spent her only week of vacation this summer moving my disorganized self out of the crater where I used to live. </p>\\n<p>Thanks to the friends I hang around most — you know who you are. In no particular order: </p>\\n<p>Special thanks to Brad Halasz for being the longest-running of all my roommates (and for picking up your stuff; New Brad’s cool too.); also, thanks for letting me crash on your couch for something like a month straight a few summers ago, and for getting passes to all those things for Hotbox, for all the crazy parties, Shambhalas and Motion Notions. Keep on Shponglin’.</p>\\n<p>Special thanks also to Ben Hoffman for being the chaotic-good force of nature that he is, for always being down with even my most ridiculous ideas, for totally destroying it with the loads to the dump during my move-out; also for still being the coolest person I’ve ever met at the Gauntlet. </p>\\n<p>Another special thanks to Jon Roe, for sharing a similarly-awful sense of humour all those years ago editing Spoof 2006 at the Gauntlet, for being the singly-most laid-back person I’ve ever met and for just being a pretty awesome all-around dude. Also, thanks for taking over the duties of party house post-graduation; I was feeling fairly antisocial there for awhile… Also, your roommates are awesome.</p>\\n<p>Thanks to Christian Louden for being an awesome roommate and friend; thanks also to Aldo Aguirre — I didn’t get to know you that well, but you’re in the uppermost bracket in terms of cool roommates I’ve had. Thanks similarly to Ben Taylor — dude, we totally have to grab a pint now that I’m in London.</p>\\n<p>Thanks to Cody Torgerson for starting the Campus Greens and getting me involved on some level with the environmental movement in Calgary; also thanks for all the times we’ve discussed technology over beers, it’s always fun.</p>\\n<p>Thanks to Chris Beauchamp, the hardest working man in the north Albertan creative media industry — in the bit over a decade I’ve been developing websites, I’ve worked with countless designers, and nobody comes even close to Chris’ level of professionalism, comprehensiveness and style. The work he produces is seriously bad-ass. Speaking as an outsource web-developer who has done quite a lot of work with Chris, his designs are a joy to put into code. Beyond that, thanks for being the first editor I dealt with at the Gauntlet and doing so much to help me improve my writing back then.</p>\\n<p>Thanks to Angela Larsen for the boilerplate contracts, for helping with photos at Motion Notion and for being there for Siyuan. The world would be a better place if everyone had such good friends.</p>\\n<p>Thanks to Barnaby Bennett for being a totally rad dude and for getting me into so many shows.

Thanks also to Tony Grimes (of Siteline Solutions, my other outsource partner) for giving me some interesting projects to work on, and for connecting me to the broader Calgary web-development community through Pixels ‘n’ Pints. Another thanks to Fred Pattison for giving me an awesome employment opportunity all those years ago and more writing material than I’ll ever know what to do with — really, much of what I’ve done in the last few years is a direct result of having worked at the The Next Level. </p>\\n<p>Thanks to the entire CJSW crew for always killing it around the clock, day after day, week after week. Big special thanks to Joe Burima for getting me involved with CJSW’s web stuff in the first place, and also for writing me an awesome reference letter. Thanks to Paul Kennett for also writing me a reference — very much appreciated. Thanks to Mitch Bundy for being one of the most awesome technologists I’ve met; Chad Saunders, Kat Dornian, Hayley Muir, Nathan Taylor and Marc Affeld for just being incredibly helpful and friendly — y’all rock. Thanks also to Lotus Queen and Tokyo Eyepatch for doing their thing and providing some much needed bass to the Calgary airwaves. I could go on; CJSW is one of the best things Calgary has going for it right now.</p>\\n<p>While I’m on CJSW people, thanks to Kat Lord for being one of the single most friendly people I’ve met; I didn’t really get a chance to talk to you or Charlotte given how crazy the going away party was, but I hope both of you are doing well in your new environments.

A few others come to mind: Amanda Hu, Paul Baker, Danny Kirk, Chris Pedersen and Noah Miller — y’all are cool too! Additionally, extra thanks to both Chris Beauchamp and Katy Anderson, who both always encouraged me to write news — I’m probably much more competent at what I’m doing now from that experience.</p>\\n<p>Thanks to Sara Hanson and Wendy Pringle for being great roommates and for putting up with my shenanigans when I originally moved into 2816. Best of luck with whatever you’ve got going right now.</p>\\n<p>Thanks to Jasmin Frederickson for pushing me in some interesting directions and being an unusually chill person. Also for really being the first person I’d met who was also into electronic music. </p>\\n<p>Thanks to Deb Courchene for being the first person I really knew in Calgary — I might not have moved there in the first place had I not known you. Also, thanks for all the chats online while I was still in high-school; I’m probably a more balanced person now having known at that time that there’s intelligent life outside Moose Jaw.</p>\\n<p>Thanks to Becky Schnurr-Howsam for all the chats; you always have a tendency of giving me good advice when I need it the most. </p>\\n<p>Thanks to Keith Fagin for getting me involved with some interesting technology projects and for always fighting the good fight. Thanks to Marco Renda for giving me the opportunity to edit at my very first magazine and for caring deeply about a topic very few understand. Thanks to Katrina Mary Jade for letting me work on some cool projects — while I’m not sure where those calendars will fit into my life’s œuvre, I’m glad to have had the opportunity to work on them. Thanks to everyone who worked on Hotbox with me; I know it didn’t really pan out like we expected, but I certainly see value in the work we did.</p>\\n<p>Thanks to all the teachers who made taking a Communications degree at the UofC worthwhile. Allison Dube, Ron Glasberg, Bart Beaty, Paul Kennett, Barry Cooper (I disagree with you on nearly everything you espouse, but I enjoyed your class regardless; the segment on Voegelin was fantastic.), Gwendolyn Blue, Brian Grant and, frankly, anybody who ever gave me an extension — most people on that list, actually. </p>\\n<p>Thanks to my friends in and from Moose Jaw — Joel Kreutzwieser, Gordon Runn, Vince Langevin, Kurt and Trish Gillett, Tony Wong and the rest — for setting up our yearly LAN party and keeping that going as one of the things I know I can always look forward to every Christmas. </p>\\n<p>Thanks to Steve Watkins for staying in contact while in Edmonton and being great to visit with.</p>\\n<p>Thanks to my extended relatives — I know you generally have no clue why I do what I do, but I appreciate that you at least attempt to understand it.</p>\\n<p>Thanks to Ishkur and everyone on the Ishboard, moot for 4chan, Kirtaner for 420chan — you’ve all influenced me probably more than I’d care to admit. Thanks to the Drupal, WordPress and Joomla! communities for all the free software and support — you’ve paid my rent on many an occasion. Thanks to Kyle for setting up the Minecraft server I play on — it’s one of the few collaborative, creative enterprises I have with people in Calgary, I really do appreciate the effort.</p>\\n<p>Yeah, that’s about it.

Some months we’d just have an open discussion; others, we could have a specific goal, whether that’s to run a workshop (I’d be happy to spend an hour or two teaching folks how to make their portfolio site really sizzle) or brainstorm ways to build some highly-disruptive technology before letting it loose on the London media environment. </p>\\n<p>It doesn’t even have to get that technical — if nothing else, we could just use the hour to expend huge amounts of public resources by making a bunch of FoI requests through <a href=\\\"http://www.whatdotheyknow.com\\\">WhatDoTheyKnow.com</a>. <em>“Dear Islington Council — what taxpayer funds are spent on toilet paper every year?

Such was the case yesterday; I had anticipated our interviewing class would be over no later than 4:00 p.m. (giving us an hour to return from Westminster to the university), but in reality it lasted until 4:30 p.m., giving us no hope in returning in time to make the meeting. I made an executive decision to move the meeting to a nearby pub so at least a few of us could discuss things and attempted to inform anyone else who had previously expressed interest that this was the case; apologies to anyone who showed up at Saddlers.</p>\\n<p>Two notes on that point:</p>\\n<h2>1. Meetings are now <em>every</em> <em>Monday</em> @ <em>5 pm</em></h2>\\n<p>Eventually these will change to be biweekly or even monthly, with the intent of creating smaller breakout groups to focus on specific tasks or ideas with more frequent meeting times. This will be impossible until we reach a certain critical mass, so we’re going to try meeting more frequently this semester and with a focus on discussion and logistics. With any luck, we can start moving towards a project-based focus by next semester.</p>\\n<p>Additionally, it has been suggested we move to <strong>Monday</strong> evening in fairness to the non-Newspaper/Interactive folk. This makes a lot of sense — all of us are in Greenslade’s lecture and will thus be in the same area at the same time.</p>\\n<h2>2. News, discussion and updates will be posted in the <strong>#cityjtech</strong> hashtag; announcements posted from <strong><a href=\\\"http://www.twitter.com/cityjtech\\\">@cityjtech</a></strong></h2>\\n<p>It would’ve been a lot easier to inform people the venue had changed had I created a hashtag earlier on. I’m proposing #cityjtech (and have registered <a href=\\\"http://www.twitter.com/cityjtech\\\">@cityjtech</a>) for this purpose. We could use #cjtech if people are finding that too long, but I figure consistency and descriptiveness are more important at this point. Please comment if you disagree.</p>\\n<h3>Addressing some misconceptions</h3>\\n<p>To address a few questions I’ve been receiving:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Do I need to know a lot about programming?</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Not at all! Some of the projects we’ll eventually work towards will involve some heavy development work, but this is where City’s epic alumni network will come in. Your experience and aptitude as a journalist is what will make this group special. For non-journalists, your outside experience will greatly aid our discussion. If you do program, your technical expertise will be helpful in moving ideas forward. <strong>Everyone is welcome, regardless of technical knowledge.</strong></li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Is this a big time commitment?</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>It doesn’t need to be. This group is designed to allow a broad spectrum of participation — everything from contributing ideas and discussion to hacking code. MA programmes are really labour-intensive; commit at a level you’re comfortable with.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Is this just a bunch of stuff about WordPress?</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>It won’t be. Some focus on WordPress is natural given how widely used it is in our programme and the ease with which it can be extended. However, while WordPress is great for some purposes, it really isn’t the future of online journalism — it’s a blogging platform. If you find WordPress terribly uninteresting, please say so! There’s lots of room for technology of all sorts.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h3>Finally, we have some champions!</h3>\\n<p>In project management terms, a champion is somebody who will invest time and energy to see that an initiative succeeds. For City J-Tech, I’m asking champions regularly show up for meetings and tweet about CULJTEG events. These people can essentially be considered group co-founders.

Not getting anything resembling a response, I ended up writing a whole schwack of MySQL statements.

Alas, I was a total jerk and couldn’t find the SQL I use and ended up ignoring most of them.</p>\\n<p><strong>Until today!</strong></p>\\n<p>Note that the following is <strong>not</strong> a one-click script that will import your users.

I take no responsibility if you screw something up with it!</p>\\n<p>Also attached to this post is an importer script <a href=\\\"http://www.dimunation.com\\\">Michael Dimunation</a> sent me awhile back after I emailed him the SQL query in question.

This time I’ve interviewed Paul Bradshaw, Editor at the <a href=\\\"http://onlinejournalismblog.com\\\">Online Journalism Blog</a> and lecturer at <a href=\\\"http://www.city.ac.uk\\\">City University London</a>.</em></p>\\n<p>Ændrew Rininsland: You said at one point that universities aren’t producing very many journalists going into Computer Assisted Reporting (CAR). Why do you think that is?</p>\\n<p>Paul Bradshaw: I think it’s partly because of what motivates people to do journalism in the first place, and students’ perceptions of journalism. Traditionally, journalism is about writing, it’s about telling stories, and people are attracted to journalism because they like the idea of writing stories — they are communicators. It’s an Arts subject, and Arts students tend to be good communicators, are able to structure a narrative in a story and find what’s interesting in newsworthy material. That used to be enough in journalism, but the conflict you’re getting now is that anyone can tell the news, can communicate these stories. Some of the stuff that journalists get away with as part of their job, the kind of content processing or “churnalism” that makes up a lot of journalism — the competition is so high that it’s really not justified anymore. I don’t think you can sit in an office and call yourself a journalist when there are hundreds of thousands of people doing exactly what you are, and in some cases, doing it better because they’re more passionate and are better writers. I think people come into to journalism courses with an image of themselves and of journalism that is out of date, so they don’t see the value of CAR and may see themselves as not the types of people who could do that; they might not seem themselves as numerate or good with computers.</p>\\n<p>Q: Has there been a gradual revolution in the perception of CAR by established journalists over the past 10-20 years? How have attitudes changed towards it?</p>\\n<p>A: I think journalists have seen the potential of CAR much more quickly than they have other types of journalism that involves technology, and I think that’s because they can see the editorial value in that and because there have been huge stories that have been about CAR. For instance, the MP expenses story — a story of a generation, really — was about having to deal with this huge amount of data and finding stories in it, connections in it. The Wikileaks story — again, a story of a generation — really, those have been two of the biggest stories of the last 20-30 years, and when other journalists look at those, they can say “How did they do those stories?” Well, the first thing the Guardian did was build a database. The first thing the Telegraph did was having people fill spreadsheets. In that sense, journalists have gotten to grips with CAR relatively quickly, particularly in the last couple of years. But there’s still a lag between that cultural understanding and the actual ability to do it. That, I think, is where you come up against the barrier of journalists seeing that as somebody else’s job — that’s the geek’s job, or we’ll get our developers to do that. That is changing; there is a lot of investment. For example, the BBC is training up thousands of journalists in basic CAR skills, and I’m getting approaches from magazine publishers and Australian news organisations and things like that. So it is changing, but it takes a long time to train a lot of journalists. What we’ll also increase that change is the increasing amount of data the government is publishing and the increasing amount of stories being done by people outside of news organisations who can interrogate that data.</p>\\n<p>Q: What are the most significant ways in which workflow has changed within the newsroom due to CAR?</p>\\n<p>A: I still think the workflow is relatively unchanged. There are efforts to change that — for example, at the Financial Times, I know that they are trying very hard to make the organisation more efficient and effective and collaborative in the way they deal with data. They have to deal with spreadsheets every day, but those spreadsheets stay on those reporters’ desktops. They’ve done a lot of work with XML, allowing reporters to access data but also driving interactives and graphics on the site so those are constantly updated. I think that’s something that’s increasingly going to be the case. The Guardian obviously is way ahead in terms of systematically dealing with data and publishing it and discussing it and making it a social artefact. But I think for most other organisations, it’s still something that other people do and it will take another significant reorganisation — we’ve had a lot of reorganisation of news teams where people are now working on a 24-hour rolling basis, things like that — probably the next big shift will be to reorganise people again so that data is embedded in the way that everyone works, and if that data is shared, it feeds into live publishing, it feeds into apps, there is a lot of commercial potential, which I think a lot of companies are exploring.</p>\\n<p>Q: What avenues do you see as being the most likely to bring CAR to the average newsroom?</p>\\n<p>A: I think the first thing is big stories, which have already happened and will continue to happen. News organisations being embarrassed by being beaten to stories by other organisations. So I think the Guardian’s continued work, Channel 4’s Fact Check — those sorts of projects. If other journalists feel that they should be keeping up with this, then that will probably push things. Also, money. The more commercial opportunities come out of data, then that ultimately will be the bottom line.</p>\\n<p>Q: While CAR and open data are somewhat different movements, how do you see the latter impacting the former?</p>\\n<p>A: The big difference is that CAR tends to take place on the desktop, or at least traditionally has. Journalists have worked on that in isolation; as I say, you have situations where other journalists within the same organisation don’t even know that data exists. You have situations where a team in one department will be gathering all sorts of data and there’s duplication of effort. Open data allows people to connect data sets more easily, get insights into those connections, add extra context, avoid basic errors around data and also to make stories a more collaborative effort — not just in the sense of it being easier to do for a news organisation, but people being engaged. Again, the Guardian shows the incredible engagement people can have with their stories.</p>\\n<p>Q: Do you think people who do CAR are viewed differently within the newsroom? Do you think there’s a separation between the CAR people and other journalists, or do you think it’s becoming more of a collaborative skill that people throughout the newsroom learn?</p>\\n<p>A: I think it depends on the newsroom. There are very established journalists who use spreadsheets regularly and I don’t think they’re thought of any differently because of that. As long as what they produce is what other journalists produce — and in some circumstance, quite often better. Where there is a distinction is when somebody comes in with that as their job title; they’re a specialist in data rather than a journalist in a particular field who happens to use spreadsheets and forms and reports. I think there’s a lot of traditional journalists who use these skills, but they don’t really talk about it, and then there are journalists where that defines them. There’s value in both, but there are people who start with basic journalism and gain those skills and people who begin with those skills and gain more journalism skills as time goes on. I think it’s probably more to do with job title and organisational structure than to do with the skills themselves. In terms of collaboration, I think that more of a general change in society, which is that technology has allowed us to be collaborative and reduced the importance and role of a formal organisation. Journalists are just part of that change in having to learn to collaborate with people outside of their organisations, just like in any other industry.</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"The Evolving Newsroom: Q&A with Paul Bradshaw\",\"date\":\"May 08, 2012\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"path\":\"content/evolving-newsroom-qa-paul-bradshaw\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/content-evolving-newsroom-qa-paul-bradshaw.json\n// module id = 571\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"aendrew.com v8\",\"author\":\"Aendrew Rininsland\"}},\"markdownRemark\":{\"id\":\"/Users/andrew.rininsland/Projects/OTHER/aendrew.github.io/src/pages/2012-05-08-evolving-newsroom-qa-conrad-quilty-harper/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"html\":\"<p><em>The Evolving Newsroom is a series of Q&#x26;As with important names in the data journalism field, discussing how the newsroom is evolving to better incorporate data and data-driven journalism. To start things off, I’ve talked to Conrad Quilty-Harper, who is the Interactive News Editor for the Telegraph.</em></p>\\n<p>Ændrew Rininsland: You’d written for Engadget before, what was it like going from a technology website to a traditional newspaper?</p>\\n<p>Conrad Quilty-Harper: Well, I’d worked for Engadget back in 2007, so quite awhile ago. I was working for a lot of blogs, not just Engadget, and then I worked for Mahalo.com, which is an Internet startup. </p>\\n<p>In terms of differences between those organisations, there isn’t much difference — they’re all very good publications, chasing news and doing it better than other publications. I’ve predominantly worked for online at the Telegraph, so essentially I’ve got the additional thing which is print; we’re a newspaper, and they’re very different beasts, online and print. But in terms of finding a good story, presenting it in an accurate way, there’s difference in workflows and tools we use, but there’s no essential difference in story sense and treating stories and sources  — those are pretty universal skills.</p>\\n<p>Q: Please describe your day, beginning to end.</p>\\n<p>A: I have kind of a split in types of work that I produce. One day I might be working on one to three one-off graphics, whether that’s charts or tables or some kind of interactive feature that represents the day’s news. We’ll produce a kind of quick-turnaround graphic that will go and amplify those stories, pick out a new angle in it that you can’t tell very well with words, pictures or videos, and is better told in an infographic sense. So there’s that, which is kind of the core activity; on top of that there’s more in-depth projects that might be on a week-long basis. [Someone] was working on a cycle map, so he came to us with this data and we found a story in it and we thought “How could we better represent it?” and that was something we worked on for a week or two before it went live. And then, on top of that, there’s even longer-term projects, which starts to get into the data journalism territory of the Wikileaks project, investigations into government spending. Those are very in-depth, month-long projects. It’s kind of a mix of those three time scales, and depending on what’s in the news, what news you’ve got or what sources you’re working with, then you’ll adapt based on those three things. </p>\\n<p>In terms of the day-to-day, I’ll do some forward planning looking at the diary for government calendars and what data releases are coming out, what will be on the agenda for tomorrow, what will be on the agenda for the next week, thinking how we can prepare for that. A big part is planning and making sure you know what’s going to happen, or trying to predict what’s going to happen. First thing in the morning you generally think about what graphics we’ve got from the day before that we can finish off before our 12 o’clock conference, and then at 12 o’clock conference you look to all the section editors and the editors themselves and think of more ideas for later on in the day and going into tomorrow. I work with a couple of graphic designers, a dedicated developer and another journalist, and we’ll discuss what we’re going to be working on, or another journalist will provide some data, and we’ll discuss that with the developer and the designer. The designer will tell us how it should work and then the developer will code it, and we’ll work with the developer throughout the process of how it’s going to look. Generally we sit four or five people discussing what’s coming up, what’s happening now, and how can we adapt our tools to fit in order to make a great graphic or advance some kind of story somewhere using data.</p>\\n<p>Q: How big is your team?</p>\\n<p>I’m working with a team of four other people directly, which is not at full capacity yet but will be next month. We will be doing the day-to-day stuff, making sure to get the day-to-day graphics up and making sure we have longer term projects to show off our work and working on longer-term investigations and collecting data. I’ve worked with the Lobby team quite closely, there’s about half a dozen journalists I’ve worked with on investigations for front page stories, interactives to go with front-page stories — our team works across the newsroom as well. In a sense, we provide some service to other areas, but I like it better if we’re presented with ideas and we choose the best idea, run with it and turn it into something that suits our medium. We’re not daily newspaper reporters, we don’t run out into the street and find out this information — we will generally digest information and write the right tool that goes with it.</p>\\n<p>Q: It seems you mainly do online stuff. Do you ever interact with the print side of it?</p>\\n<p>A: I’ve done many newspaper stories that are newspaper stories first and foremost, traditional scoops. They’ll go up online as well, and vice-versa. There’s no distinction between the two; if there’s a good story in print, it’ll be a good story online, and generally that means you’ll get a good graphic out of it. There’s no real distinction in terms of the medium.</p>\\n<p>Q: In what ways do your interactions with the news editor and the web editor differentiate? </p>\\n<p>A: It’s like any other newsroom, really; I’ll come up with a pitch for a story and will present it to a specialist or news editor, and they will make a judgement on it, and that will determine where it goes. It’s no different than any type of story, picture gallery, interview or whatever.</p>\\n<p>Q: Would you mind describing that workflow a little bit, how it goes from writing to the web?</p>\\n<p>A: We have a CMS, and I will write the story offline, share it with lawyers if need be, share it with an editor, share it with my team. I might not do all of that, I don’t always show stories to the lawyers or editors; sometimes I’m asked to do stories by editors, so I’ll write with them and work on graphics because of a request, but then I’ll just copy and paste it into the CMS, write the headlines, check that all the SEO terms are done correctly, put the graphic on the article; it’s just like any blog or WordPress. We all self-publish — everyone at the Telegraph self-publishes their work.</p>\\n<p>Q: So it’s very much a web-first workflow, in that it’s driven to having stories online first.</p>\\n<p>A: Yes; if it’s a breaking news story we’ll tend to put it online first, because we’re trying to keep ahead of everyone else. Things will get held back for the paper, but those are generally exclusives. If we’re doing something that’s exclusive to our newspaper, we’ll generally let the newspaper announce it and then it will go online, though that’s not a rule. But those decisions are a bit above my pay grade, I’m not one of those editors. </p>\\n<p>Q: How do other news writers perceive of your work?</p>\\n<p>A: They generally get lots of benefit out of our work. Our graphics are generally highly supplementary to their stories, you want a good interactive to tell your story better. I’ve only had positive reactions from journalists at the Telegraph to my work.</p>\\n<p>Q: But do you feel that other writers understand the data-driven aspect of it, and how data feeds into finding stories?</p>\\n<p>A: Yes, data journalism is not a new thing, reporters have always worked with data and information that’s in a spreadsheet format or a list. If you go back through out archives, we’ve always been working with numbers and data journalism’s not a new thing. The better word I prefer is “data-driven journalism,” so what you mean is I have a data set and I’m trying to find a story from it — the data will be the first thing that brings you to that information. Maybe you find that data and you find a story, but most of the time you’re led to that data and then you’ll find a story in that data. Having interactive graphics and having a team dedicated to processing large sets of tricky-to-process data is something that I’ve always had thanks for — or need for more of — from other reporters. All you need to do is show how easy you can get a scanned PDF into an  spreadsheet and write your headline figures — [after the] one time you do that with a reporter, they get it.</p>\\n<p>Q: In the time you’ve been at the Telegraph, how has its newsroom changed, in relation to new technology or the open data movement? Do you perceive of there being any changes? Is it continual evolutionary process?</p>\\n<p>A: We’ve continually updated our tools and technology. We’re quite far ahead from where we were 18 months ago, in terms of tools we have available to ourselves and other reporters, in terms of charts and tables and processing data — but we haven’t stopped, we’re continually pushing forward with new tools and new techniques.</p>\\n<p>Q: In what ways have these new tools informed the reporting that you do?</p>\\n<p>A: My favourite little piece of software is PDF2XL, which allows you to take scans and turn them into Excel. It’s quite a simple thing if you put it like that, but actually, if you’re under deadline and are trying to get some information up quickly, this is an invaluable tool. It’s something I didn’t have a year ago and it’s enabled us to do a page 4 spread in the newspaper on refused honours — people who have refused honours. That was released by the cabinet office and was in a PDF they’d released with horrible formatting, badly scanned, scratchy image. In half an hour, we were able to take that and put it into a format we were able to put into our CMS for online and make an interactive table. You can search the names, you can see Lucien Freud, you can see Roald Dahl just by typing in “Dahl.” That was one of the key; I’d previously not seen any technology that could do it, but this software does it all. We also have a server that enables us to run PHP code… We’ve got databases now that we didn’t have before, that enable us to run bigger infographics and run our services — our tools and generators. That’s all new stuff.</p>\\n<p>Q: What’s your favourite part of the job?</p>\\n<p>A: I like all of it — I enjoy working on groundbreaking stories that people want to read, and also presenting complex information in an easy-to-understand manner. I like the new angles of it — for instance, with budgets, one of my stories was a council credit card spending scandal. They’d spent a hundred million on credit cards, and you can see the kind of colour in the story, but what we were able to do using these tools was take all this data from 200 councils and publish it all online for everyone to see. Which meant you had not only did you have your big impact story, but you also had 200 individual stories that people in their local area could examine and take their local politicians to account for their spending, or even congratulate them for not spending that. The sense of transparency enabled by doing large datasets and making it very contextual for people living in their local areas is something I really get excited about. It’s not only doing a good newspaper story, a good online story — it’s being able to do extra stuff and push it forward a bit further.</p>\\n<p>Q: With that in mind, what’s your take on opening up the data behind stories?</p>\\n<p>A: I do it every story, every story you can access our data. We never hide our data. Mainly because, why would we hide it? We want people to read our stuff, why would we hide our information? If people want to know the workings behind our stuff, we’ll always release it. We’ll always release the methodology, so people can hold us to account as well. If we want to hold governments to account and ask them to be more transparent, I don’t see why we shouldn’t be more transparent ourselves.</p>\\n<p>Q: Is there any instance where somebody’s taken some of your data and done something really impressive with it?</p>\\n<p>A: One of my favourite examples was the other way around — the Guardian had worked with an academic on the new boundary changes released by the boundary commission as a draft proposal. We were really frustrated, because the boundary commission had not released any interactive, reusable maps — they had released 600 PDFs with individual images of maps, that we couldn’t show to our audience as “This is your local area, this is how your boundaries have changed.” So the Guardian contacted an academic in Sheffield, who managed to figure out how to use the table data and connect that to ward-level areas, and they created an interactive map and put it side-by-side. So what we did was take their data — which we’re allowed to do under the Creative Commons license they release their data under — and we improved on it by linking the two maps together. You had the old map and the new map, and when you moved one map they moved together, when you zoomed in, they both zoomed in. So it was like two sheets of paper together on a desk; that kind of intuitiveness. And the Guardian actually borrowed our design back — in terms of collaboration, that’s the best example of what two newspapers are capable of doing. They sourced the data, we improved on the interaction and provided our input, and they improved their design likewise. There are other examples of going back and forth — we’ve used Guardian data and provided a link back and so on. It’s quite a mutually-beneficially arrangement; if you release the data transparently and have a mind of “Let’s improve this together,” you can do good things.</p>\\n<p>Q: Given the nature of sharing data and collaborative data, how would you describe your relation with other newsroom data teams?</p>\\n<p>A: Friendly! (laughs) We constantly take inspiration from other newsrooms. The New York Times is leading the field in this space and they have a massive team of 20-plus people, but we also try to take inspiration from the HTML5 movement as well. There’s quite a big culture of people out there who are just experimenting with new ways of displaying information, and new, open source tools you can use. We use a visual library I think an intern wrote somewhere in Chicago, and it’s where you take map boundaries and make them interactive, so you can click on them and change data. We use that tool and provide help to them, they provide help to us on how to update it and make it work. You’ve got Document Cloud, we’ve given some bug reports to them… There’s a whole bunch of tools out there and different bodies, making the harder tasks easier. </p>\\n<p>Q: How do you see the current state of open data within the UK?</p>\\n<p>A: It’s been good progress so far, and I’m really happy to see the kind of progress, and I’ve written about how happy I am with the open data agenda and how pretty much every bit of it has been reached on some level. I’m not happy with certain bits — I wrote an article about how crap the crime mapping has been — but it’s slowly improving, and there’s always more they can release. We have constantly done stories about new data sets that are not on the agenda and there’s always more. There’s never going to be enough. (laughs) The government is running consultations about it and we’ve had a say and given our two cents, but part of our job is to put pressure on the government and different bodies to release this data. You can put it in a way that helps both sides — “If you release this data it helps you look better, you’re more transparent” — and we can get a good graphic out of it, present information to the public and allow other developer to reuse it. It’s all mutually beneficial. Progress has been good so far, but there’s a long way to go, particularly in the mapping government areas. </p>\\n<p>Q: What’s the most frustrating aspect of your job?</p>\\n<p>A: Scanned PDFs, or data provided on the back of a piece of paper. Part of my job is about identifying areas that are bottlenecks in terms of data and how can we get access to this data in a structured format so we can create graphics around it or automate activity that people are manually doing. I don’t really find it frustrating, it’s part of my job. Part of my job is to reduce the frustration and do innovative things that were very frustrating.</p>\\n<p>Q: How do you see the idea of data-driven journalism evolving?</p>\\n<p>A: We’ve experimented with live data in the past — we did an interactive map of the royal wedding that had people tweeting experiences from the event as it was happening. We’d like to do more in that field. Interactivity in terms of people providing data to us, we’ve been trying these quizzes — we recently did a very successful one on Alzheimer’s, where you could put down if you suspect your relative had started suffering from Alzheimer’s and could put symptoms in, which were provided by a medical body. It had an interactive element; it’s that kind of stuff that interacts with social networks, we’re putting our data from our stories in front of people in a way that’s understandable and readable, making them react to it, and making them take action based on it. ProPublica did an experiment, linking one of their stories about schools to Facebook, so you could see your local area and share stories about your local school. That’s a really agenda-setting kind of experiment and I think we’ll see more of that.</p>\\n<p>Q: How does social media — particularly Facebook and Twitter — inform the workflow of your day?</p>\\n<p>A: Very much so. On a very simple level, if people are having technical difficulties with our applications and infographics, we will usually find out from them using Twitter and we can then send them a message saying we’ve fixed it. But also, taking the council credit card example again, that caused a dozen different stories in different areas, so you can track on social media how people are reacting to your story and see follow-up angles. People asking questions about your data or raising an interesting angle you might not have thought of, or put some context to it that makes it a better story — you can always track that. It’s very useful as sentiment tracking for what people are thinking about your work. Also, with the quiz example, we’ve done some quizzes where you can share what’s your virtual diet and how addicted to gadgets you are. At the end, you get a score, saying you’re addicted to gadgets or you don’t use gadgets very much, and users could share that on Twitter and compare with their friends. We’ve had really good success with that and people like those sorts of things. News games using social media might be something we explore as well.</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"The Evolving Newsroom: Q&A with Conrad Quilty-Harper\",\"date\":\"May 08, 2012\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"path\":\"content/evolving-newsroom-qa-conrad-quilty-harper\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/content-evolving-newsroom-qa-conrad-quilty-harper.json\n// module id = 572\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"aendrew.com v8\",\"author\":\"Aendrew Rininsland\"}},\"markdownRemark\":{\"id\":\"/Users/andrew.rininsland/Projects/OTHER/aendrew.github.io/src/pages/2012-04-19-potential-quickfix-if-wordpress-starts-refusing-recognize-page-templates-custom-taxonomies/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"html\":\"<p>Is WordPress being sofa kingdom by returning Error 404 for custom taxonomies, or doesn’t recognize taxonomy-{name}.php template files in your theme?

Next, I’ve talked with Aron Pilhofer, Editor of Interactive News at the <a href=\\\"http://www.nytimes.com\\\">New York Times</a>.</em></p>\\n<p>Ændrew Rininsland: Could you describe a typical workday?</p>\\n<p>Aron Pilhofer: For me? Lots and lots of meetings. Not so true for the whole group, but for me — lots and lots of meetings.</p>\\n<p>Q: So you have more of a managerial role?</p>\\n<p>A: Right.</p>\\n<p>Q: How then would you describe a work day for a typical journalist on your team?</p>\\n<p>A: Well, it depends what they’re working on. They may or may not be part of those meetings, they might be writing a heck of a lot of code — they’re obvious writing a heck of a lot more code than I am these days. But I’m not sure there’s such a thing as a typical day — our projects do tend to be very, very different. If we have a project that’s a quick turnaround kind of thing, chances are it will be a different kind of experience than if it were a long turnaround thing, like in elections, where it’s in a constant state of release, revise, try something, tweak it, release it again, see if it works — stuff like that. Conceiving of different elements of this through the arc of a story or event.</p>\\n<p>Q: Would you say the work your team does is an extension of Computer Assisted Reporting (CAR)?</p>\\n<p>A: I do think that it is; I know that reasonable people can disagree about this, but I do think that these roles fall very naturally outside of the tradition of the CAR movement from the ‘80s and ‘90s. It goes back before then, but it really wasn’t until ubiquitous personal computer had arrived that it was really cost-effective who could specialize in that.</p>\\n<p>Q: In what ways has the newsroom adapted to these new methodologies in reporting?</p>\\n<p>A: Well, I don’t know I would say that — I very much think that’s a worth in progress. I do think we do a lot more web-first type projects than we ever had in the past. I think that some of the projects we’re able to do or conceive of are influenced heavily by the kinds of things we’re now capable of doing, that we weren’t in the past. In the past, we were pretty much shackled to whatever our content management system provided and whatever templates our designers and IT department were able to cram into that. I think now we’ve been able to break free from those templates and do everything from a custom-built interactive for a single event or breaking news to a full-blown website like School Book, which is the most ambitious project we’ve done editorially. The latter was a really cool process, it involved a core group of reporters, editors, my folks, all together around a table, working on a single project. It was really quite interesting to see. I don’t think the ambition to build a sub-branded experimental site like that would have or could have happened if a team like this had not existed.</p>\\n<p>Q: Why do you say that?</p>\\n<p>A: I frequently am asked “How technical do journalists need to get? Do they need to code, et cetera?” I don’t think they need to, but I think they need to have an understanding of what’s possible. The problem is, it’s much easier to say than to actually do. To actually understand what’s possible, you have to have at least a basic understanding of how all this stuff works — what are good devices for telling stories, what are bad devices for telling stories? What makes sense? To know that building a sub-branded education site in the way we did is possible, wouldn’t have been possible before. It wouldn’t have even dawned on anybody to try something like that.</p>\\n<p>Q: Given this, how do other journalists perceive of the work that you and your team do?</p>\\n<p>A: I think there’s a range. I think there are some people who are indifferent to what we’re doing and there are some people who are really into it. I think it depends — for the most part, digital writ large has been increasing in its importance over the years, and particularly with Jill [Abramson, NYT Executive Editor] taking over as editor, it’s obviously her signature priority. Everyone’s gotten the message that digital is important. It’s still not at the level as the printed newspaper, but it’s certainly closing the gap in terms of how journalists feel what’s a valuable way to spend their time. So, in most cases, journalists are quite receptive when we propose projects and things that are web-first or web-only, but that wasn’t always the case in the past — I think our election coverage absolutely showed that. As an example, we have now a dashboard — think of it as a live-blog on steroids that comingles content for a wide variety of sources into one stream of news. But one thing we’re doing to make it more interactive is we’re fielding questions. For instance, during one of the debates, which might be a two hour debate, readers are asked via Twitter or via a web form to submit questions as the debate’s going on in real time. We’re then taking those questions — in some cases, as many as half a dozen — and reporters who are there just to do that are taking those questions and answering them, basically doing a fact check. That’s something that never in a million years we would have been able to pull of before. Just the commitment to it would not have been there.</p>\\n<p>Q: Has it been difficult to get buy-in for projects like these? </p>\\n<p>A: Oh, of course it’s been hard. It’s a huge newsroom, with 1100 people. There are many parts of this newsroom that are dramatically underserved — let’s put it that way. So yeah, it’s been hard at times to get buy-in, but it’s becoming much easier. Especially in the last two years it’s become quite a bit easier.</p>\\n<p>Q: Any particular idea why that might be the case?</p>\\n<p>A: Well, I think in part it’s due to the newness of this group — and I’m talking about projects we’re working on, which often break the article template and are done outside of our content management system. These are projects that aren’t necessarily the kinds of things we’ve done before in the sense of taking them outside of the familiar templates we’ve used. It’s just become quite a bit easier because the profile of this group has grown internally quite a bit — we’ve been around and people know what we do. I don’t know whether there’s a single reason; obviously the support from the top has been incredible. I mean, Jill and John [M. Geddes, Managing Editor (Production)] are both totally into what we’re doing, and so was Bill [Keller, Executive Editor 2003-2011)]. All of those things combined make it easier. Plus we have many more people working in this team than we did five years ago. When we started it, it was three people including me. Now it’s 14. </p>\\n<p>Q: In an article for Idealab you wrote in 2010, you mentioned others in the newsroom viewed you different once you were given the title “Computer Assisting Reporting Specialist”…</p>\\n<p>A: This is a little bit of an “Inside Baseball” kind of discussion about what do you call people who do what we do, who are clearly not working in the traditional technology environment but are clearly not writing inverted pyramid-style news stories — what do you call them? I think we were struggling internally to find titles for people that made sense. And ultimately we… I don’t know, I think we kind of punted on it. I mean, our deputies are all “Editors” — that’s their title, “Deputy Editor.” And that makes sense, because they’re doing things that editors do. There are folks underneath them who play what might be described in a traditional software environment as an “architect” role, but there’s really not a newsroom analogy to that. “Editor” sounds weird and forced. We’ve struggled with it, trying to find the right terminology to describe who these people are and what they do and so forth. Now, the analogy to CAR is whenever you go from being a journalist who uses data to being a data journalist, people view you differently — very differently. They don’t really see you as a reporter as much as they do as someone who is able to contribute in some very focused ways. That’s not necessarily bad or good, it just means that terminology matters. So, the argument I was making here was the debate about whether or not it’s a good idea to come up with these specialist titles like “Hacker Journalist” or “Programmer Journalist” or whether the title we should be just thinking about is just “Journalist.” It’s a debate for us, it’s a debate for the CAR community and it continues to be an issue that I don’t know whether there will be a lot of resolution to.</p>\\n<p>Q: How do you perceive the open state of the open data movement, particularly in the US?</p>\\n<p>A: The open data movement here has been more focused on, as my friends at ScraperWiki are fond of saying, liberating data. Getting it out of the hands of government officials. I think that’s where the open data movement has been less successful — they’ve been largely successful, and I think you could say that data.gov is a success, and I think you can say that part of it, the transparency piece, the Sunlight Labs of the world, have been successful. But I think the problem is that you get the data — then what? Simply putting it into a database or creating a web search isn’t enough. I think the goals of the transparency movement are slightly different — related, but slightly different — from that of a journalist. It’s like a Venn diagram. We all want public officials to give up data, we want them to give up documents, we want openness and transparency. The journalist wants it as a means to an end, whereas in some cases the transparency movement has been more about the data itself being the end. I think that’s where the differences are. I think they’ve been successful here, certainly.</p>\\n<p>Q: What avenues, within the newsroom, do you see most affecting people moving forward?</p>\\n<p>A: That’s a good question, actually. Starting with when I started identifying with the CAR community back in the 1980s and early 90s, I think there was an ongoing debate about how widespread these tools and technologies could be — I think there was a bit of a naivete about it at the time. I think that’s changed, somewhat. I think we kind of believed that if we just trained enough people, if we just kept at it long enough, there wouldn’t be a need for specialists like CAR folks, and that reporters would just naturally see the value. If we could just demonstrate the value enough places, at enough times, win enough Pulitzer prizes, everyone would go “A-ha!” and have that head-slap moment where they asked “How did I ever do my job without these tools and technologies and techniques?” I think that has been largely proven to be way off-base. Right now, I think a very, very, very small subset of journalists industry-wide are even capable — I hate to say it, but even interested in many cases — of working with data in even its simplest forms. To me, I find that unbelievable and even tragic. I think, personally, I’ve wondered how you could cover a local government or a school board, how you could do your job, without some basic data skills. Particularly now, when so much government data is so available and so many public records are going electronic. Then, how is widespread what we do? Now you’ve ratcheted it up a whole other level, using data analysis for a purpose of storytelling. In some cases you’ve then added so many layers of complexity… I don’t see many journalists hacking Ruby code in the near future. I just don’t think it’s going to happen. So I’d say my short answer to your short question would be — very few reporters are going to be experiencing this in any sort of meaningful way beyond the conceptual level.</p>\\n<p>Q: So you see it as continuing more as a kind of specialist function?</p>\\n<p>A: Yeah. I don’t see that changing any time soon. And part of the reason is that it’s unfortunate but true, but even the simplest web application, you start putting a database behind something, and you put it up on the web, and if it’s not done properly, it will fall apart under even a small amount of stress and traffic. It will completely fall apart. Back in the old CAR days, it didn’t matter how terrible your SQL code was, as long as at the end of the day you got the right answer. If that sucker ran for 15 minutes because you wrote some crazy outer join, didn’t index your tables properly, hadn’t normalized your data — it didn’t matter. So long as you got the right answer. That doesn’t work on the web — there are scalability issues, a whole lot of new variables in the mix. Believe me — I got into this thinking I was very technical, and I was not technical; I just didn’t know any better. It’s a very steep climb.</p>\\n<p>Q: For people wanting to specialize in CAR, are there any technologies you’d say would be useful to have knowledge of at this stage in the game?</p>\\n<p>A: Yes and no. I guess it depends. I want to be careful that we’re talking about the same thing — for me, the most important skill to have for any reporter is having some basic data skills. Knowing your way around a spreadsheet is the most fundamentally important thing that any single reporter could learn. Then from there, you start to get slightly diminishing returns. Next on the ladder would be some basic database skills; next on the ladder would be some basic skills in statistics or mapping, GIS. When you have the opportunity to apply those skills… I think there will be fewer and fewer opportunities as you walk up this ladder. Doing some basic programming could be incredibly valuable — but like I said, it very much depends on the situation and the reporter and how motivated they are to use these tools and technologies in their day-to-day reporting. Many reporters don’t see the value, so they’re not going to do it. As a result, I usually answer this question by saying “Excel,” just leaving it at that, thinking Excel might be the gateway drug into these things. </p>\\n<p>Q: What do you think the reasons are for reporters just not having the interest in CAR?</p>\\n<p>A: At the very basic level of spreadsheets and database manager, or even Google Fusion tables or something like that encompassing bits of both and some GIS on top of that — the barrier to entry is relatively low. I don’t think it’s a question of technology so much a question of journalists just not seeing the value, that they don’t have to know it so why bother? Or finding some other excuse — to me, that’s what it is. Only when you get to the public facing things does the technology really pose a barrier, where even an inspired, highly-motivated journalist who is a beginning programmer is going to make some fundamental mistakes that could be fatal. Scalability isn’t an issue for a newspaper — once you’ve done your analysis, you write your news story. The printed page scales pretty well.

You speak to a man who claims a serious accident he was involved in was caused by a fault with the steering wheel on the car and he is aware of others who have also been involved in similar accidents.  He shows you a letter of complaint sent by his solicitor to the car manufacturer and he says he has also informed his MP.  </li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>The MP also raises these safety concerns in a telephone interview he gives you. </p>\\n<p>You contact the car manufacturer who make no comment.</p>\\n<p>a. What steps would you take before publication, could the car manufacturer stop publication, who could sue and what would be the position on damages? 5 marks</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><strong>Steps before publication?</strong> What real evidence do you have? There’s not much at the moment. More sources needed — couldn’t go to publication based on one person. Also find an expert opinion. Speak to source’s solicitor to get more backing; ask whether there’s any documented evidence to back it up. In terms of report itself: written in a balanced tone, facts have been presented, it’s not inflammatory or over the top. Are you saying these allegations are true, or simply saying they’re allegations that need to be investigated further.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><strong>Could the manufacturer stop publication?</strong> Not likely, it’s a libel case and not a confidentiality case. Under libel law, this not likely — rule against prior restraint (Bonnard v. Perryman 1891) Challenged by Green v. Associated Newspapers 2004, judges ruled that Bonnard v. Perryman was good law, not altered by Human Rights Act).)</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><strong>Who could sue?</strong> Car company be entitled to general damages for loss of reputation. If they can prove actual loss of sales or revenue, might be able to claim under special damages. Directors and chief executives could sue if reasonably identifiable, though less likely.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>b.  Following publication of a report on the issues, the magazine receives a letter of complaint from the solicitors for the car manufacturer. What are the two main defences you might rely on, explain your answer and what issues arise. 5 marks</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Defences? Justification and common law qualified privilege. Justification = allegations are true, would have to prove on balance of probabilities and have evidence to support report. Common law qualified privilege = Reynolds; reporting on matters of real public interest, if proper journalistic procedures followed (Factors set out by Lord Nicols in Reynolds v. Times Newspaper 1998). Would need to be balanced, have right to reply. Grobolaw v. Times Newspapers; Galloway v. Telegraph, Jameel v.

Explain how the law of libel and contempt applies to publications on the internet. 5 marks</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Publication on the Internet the same as any other platform. Libel, contempt equally apply.\\n<strong>Libel:</strong> If referring to ISP, may have special defence of innocent dissemination from Defamation Act 1996) Limitation period: 1 year from time of being taken down (offline: 1 year from publication). Circulation: if a small number of people, courts may dismiss the case. Geography: could be sued anywhere in the world.)\\n<strong>Contempt:</strong> Normal principles apply. Anything reported once proceedings have started that could prejudice can be contempt. Giving the jury more information, showing the subject’s face where ident is an issue, etc. etc. — the same as offline. That said, courts also allow tweeting from the court room, don’t need OK from judge if reporter. Normal rules of contempt apply.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>b. Answer a, b, c, or d. 1 mark per question, 5 marks total.</p>\\n<p>i. Who out of the following can sue for libel?\\na. The relatives of a dead person whose obituary is inaccurate (Dead and estates cannot sue for libel. Can bring to regulators, but not sue for libel.))\\nb. A political party accused of wrongdoing on an internet site (Political parties cannot sue Derbyshire County Council v Times Newspapers 1993; Goldsmith v.) Bhoyrul 1998)\\nc. <strong>A councillor accused in a newspaper of misleading the Council on a matter of public interest</strong> (Although an politician, he’s an individual and can bring case.))\\nd. A government agency accused in a live television programme of corruption (Highly unlikely.))</p>\\n<p>ii. Which of these is not a relevant issue in the defence of innocent dissemination in libel law?\\na. Who was in control of publication\\nb. Whether care was taken\\nc. Who made the statement\\nd. <strong>Whether the statement is true</strong></p>\\n<p>iii. Where an honest mistake leads to a libellous statement being published by a newspaper, the appropriate defence is likely to be?\\na. <strong>An offer of amends</strong> (Can’t have offer of amends and use justification defence at the same time. Will lower damages to reflect offer made.))\\nb. An offer of mitigation\\nc. An offer of damages\\nd. An offer of removal</p>\\n<p>iv. Which of these factors is not relevant to a defence of fair comment?\\na. What was believed at the time of publication by the publisher\\nb. <strong>Whether the jury agree with the opinion</strong>\\nc. Whether the facts in the report are true\\nd. Whether the report was on a matter of public interest</p>\\n<p>v. In libel law, a defendant has to prove:\\na. The publication is not defamatory\\nb. The publication  does not reasonably refer to the claimant\\nc. <strong>The truth of the publication</strong> (Burden of proof lies with defendent.))\\nd. All of the above</p>\\n<ol start=\\\"4\\\">\\n<li>You are reporting on a local newspaper and receive a telephone call that a local woman has gone missing and there are fears she has been murdered. You approach the police who say that a man has been arrested but as yet there is no charge:</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>What issues arise in reporting the following in an article in the newspaper?</p>\\n<p>a. Naming the man arrested, publishing a photograph showing the man and the woman on holiday together with their children and publishing a picture of the street where they live. 5 marks.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Man has been arrested, so proceedings have started and Contempt of Court Act applies. If naming man, would have to ensure guilt not implied or publishing information that would cause serious prejudice to trial. Strict liability offence, would have to be carried by Attorney General. Could also fall into libel territory — if the wrong man or implied he’s guilty, he could sue for libel. Lewis v Daily Telegraph (1964) — can’t suggest guilty, but can report has been arrested. Needs to be carefully worded.)</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>b. Publishing allegations from a family friend that the husband has had an affair in the past and is said to have a jealous nature, paying a neighbour who was the last person to see the missing woman and getting the brother of the arrested man to provide photographs. 5 marks.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>At the moment is a suspect; under Contempt of Court law, publishing an image of someone still a suspect is an offence because he/she might still be subject to an identification parade. With vacation photo — privacy issues, inappropriate to show photo of children of someone who has been arrested (children pixelated or blurred to protect privacy). Copyright clearance of photograph.)\\nPicture of street? Potential class actions — if very general without identifying particular houses or individuals, less of an issue. If focusing on 2-3 houses, possibility that those living in those houses can bring a libel action due to being accused of being a suspect. Allegations from family friend? Provides motive for crime; might not be in contempt, yet after the Jeffries case (And AG going after contempt cases more actively), would be better to avoid. Fade factor may apply — long way off from trial.)\\nPaying neighbour? Serious breach of PCC and Ofcom codes; would have to tell prosecution. Danger of criminal charge of perverting the course of justice. Even without pay, could be interpretted as another version of events — danger of being dragged into the case yourself. Very unwise to speak to witnesses as to fact before the case is over. Expert witnesses another story.\\nBrother providing photos? Would need to ask whether he’ll be a witness, and to avoid if so. If not a witness, might be able to speak to. Would have to ask who owns copyright and whether he has right to sell them. Is identity an issue relating to the suspect? What about privacy issues relating to others in the photos?</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<ol start=\\\"5\\\">\\n<li>A 17 year old schoolgirl is charged with the murder of an elderly man aged 68) It is said the man was trying to stop a fight outside a school and was pushed and he fell and hit his hit and subsequently died. </li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>a. What court will the case commence in and in what court will the trial be heard in? Will reporters be allowed into report the proceedings?</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Person is 17, so will commence in youth court. Will be transferred to Crown Court. Reporters will be allowed to report, both in Youth and Crown courts. No public in Youth Court. In Youth Court — §49 of Children and Young Persons Act applies (not identifiable). In Crown Court — §39 order, which is discretionary and granted in most cases. Might be lifted if defendant is found guilty of murder.)</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>b. What restrictions or court orders are likely to apply?</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Youth Court: §49) Crown Court: §39) If turns 18, veil of anonymity lifted.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>c. Explain the issue of “jigsaw identification” and how this could be relevant in this case. </p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Jigsaw ident: giving enough information to identify person even though not named. Details where the individual lived, which school, number of siblings, back of head shot, etc. could breach this. Shouldn’t identify individual due to §49/§39 orders. Less relevant here; more relevant to sexual offence cases.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>d. The victim’s son want to speak to you about his father to talk about the father’s life as a soldier and to highlight how easily a push and a blow to the head can lead to death. What contempt issues arise?</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Duty not to cause serious prejudice; if reporting life and times of victim, would have to give account of life and not exaggerating the facts or providing detail of the crime. Would not refer to proceedings against defendent, by referring to what she did. More scope if early in proceedings due to fade factor. Blow to head — §5 of Contempt of Court Act, allows reporting of public affairs where the risk of prejudice is incidental. If talking the danger of head injuries, more general public affairs and less risk. Would need to factor how late into proceedings it is. AG v English; AG v Mirror Group Newspapers (Leeds Footballers case). (First a §2 defence, would have to show that it wouldn’t seriously impede or cause contempt. However, could then use §5 saying that report is in public interest and the risk of prejudice is incidental.))</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>2)5 marks each </p>\\n<ol start=\\\"6\\\">\\n<li>Answer a, b, c or d . 1 mark each</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>i.

Explain the reporting restrictions that apply when reporting preliminary hearings such as a bail hearing in the magistrate’s courts and the reason for the restrictions. 5 marks.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>§8 of Magistrate Courts Act 1980 (“Barebones” rule) — can only report bare bones of trial, it’s not a full trial, it’s a bail application. Name of defendent, magistrates and lawyers, which court the hearing was in, occupation of defendent and age, actual charge and summary of charge, when and where next hearing is taking place, arrangements about bail, whether the case is being transfered to Crown Court, whether restrictions have been lifted. Can’t report why bail is not being granted, previous convictions, legal argument.

Explain what confidentiality law issues arise and discuss whether the company could stop the broadcast of the programme by an injunction. Explain the issues and arguments the court would consider. 5 marks.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Test set down in Coco v AN Clark 1969 is: is info confidential, is there a duty of confidentiality owed, has there been an unauthorized disclosure? Prince Albert v Strange; Prince Charles v Associated Newspapers. Could company get injunction? Could apply for it, court would have to look at test of confidentiality, art. 10 of European Convention on Human Rights (Is there a public interest in this being disclosed?), §12(3) Human Rights Act about injunction being granted for confidentiality (No injunction is to be granted to restrain publication unless applicant is able to establish publication would not be allowed — i.e., only if applicant is likely to win case). Not highlighting illegal behaviour, so no public interest defence. Confidential document that would only be obtainable by a 3rd party working for the company. If not showing illegal behaviour, reasonable case for keeping documents confidential. If illegal behaviour, different matter.)</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>b. Could the company obtain disclosure of the source of the documents and the return of the documents? Explain the issues and arguments the court would need to consider. 5 marks.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>§10 of Contempt of Court Act 1981, basic provision a court should not order disclosure of sources unless: a. Matter of national security b. Prevention of crime c. Interests of justice. If tests satisfied, could defend with Art. 10 (Right to impact information), the right to protect whistleblowers in the public interest. Company would say it’s important to identify the disloyal employee. Major cases (X v Morgan Grampian 1990, Goodwin v UK; Mersey Care NHS Trust v Ackroyd). Camelot v Centaur Communications 1999; company ordered to disclose where they got some information re: directors pay. Could seek a warrant from the court, or ask the police to return it (stolen property. If police asked to investigate, police would have to seek disclosure of the documents before PACE activates — i.e., would have to seek court order under PACE; to get that, would have to seek evidence for an indictable offence, would have to show they’d sought disclosure; likely to be excluded material, i.e., that under confidential circumstances.))</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<ol start=\\\"8\\\">\\n<li>What PCC/Ofcom and legal issues arise in the following situations?</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>a. Publishing a photograph of a footballer and his son sitting at a table outside a restaurant having a meal </p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Is there a reasonable expectation of privacy? Although seems a public place, footballer should have reasonable expectation of privacy. Somewhat similar to being in a church or a road accident. Has the celeb sought publicity about family? If so, perhaps more justification for showing that. Might also ask about the circumstances relating to the particular photo — has the photo been taken seriously, by a member of the public by chance, something going to cause deep personal offence, etc? Issues to do with protecting children — Murray v Big Pictures 2008, i.e., the J.K. Rowling case. Might be advisable to pixelate child.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>b. Reporting on a suicide where a man jumped from a window, showing a photograph of the person just before they jumped and flowers being laid at the scene</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>PCC/Ofcom rules say to show a sensitivity; shouldn’t show moment of death; have to regard privacy issues and sensitivity towards the family; shouldn’t give explicit details as to what happened. First photo would need to regard sensitivity of the family. Second might not be possible if it shows people in deep grief; however, if a public display of grief (i.e., laying flowers), might be more acceptable to do so.)</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>c. Reporting at a school</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Basic principle is that you have to seek permission from the school, e.g., head teacher. Should have permission in writing. Pupils shouldn’t be asked questions beyond their general capability to answer and should avoid asking questions about personal issues or controversial topics (parents might complain).)</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>d. Following a criminal trial where the defendant was found guilty, paying the defendant’s wife and a juror to tell their story about their thoughts on the case. </p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Paying a criminal or an associate is “highly unusual” unless with really high public interest (Tony Martin case; PCC case involving Jonathan Aitken’s daughter). §8 of Contempt of Court Act — should not ask juror how decision in jury room was made. General thoughts on case or thought on defendent, or running of courts, etc. should be okay. But <strong>must not</strong> go into jury deliberations.)</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>2)5 marks (Each, I’m guessing)</p>\\n<ol start=\\\"9\\\">\\n<li></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>a.

Next I’ve spoken with Simon Rogers, Editor at the <a href=\\\"http://guardian.co.uk\\\">Guardian</a>’s <a href=\\\"http://guardian.co.uk/data\\\">Data Store</a> and <a href=\\\"http://guardian.co.uk/news/datablog\\\">Data Blog</a>.</em></p>\\n<p>Ændrew Rininsland: To start with, would you mind describing a typical workday?</p>\\n<p>Simon Rogers: We start by thinking about the news of the day — what’s going on today, what can we add to, what can we compliment, and is there stuff we can get stories out of by investigating and looking it? Because there’s not very many of us, we have to be very focused, we can’t look at everything. We also have different specializations — James [Ball] may focus on more investigative stuff, I might pick up some of the more mainstream stories. It really varies, depending on what we’re interested in. A news editor once said that the way to choose what you do each day is to look at things that interest you, because if it interests you, it will interest somebody else. I really believe that, you have to pick up things you can really add to.</p>\\n<p>We’ll look at that, and often then it goes into getting ahold of the data. Often we try to aim stuff for lunchtime, and the reason for doing that because is the web has sort of midday phenomenon, even with all of our U.S. readers. If you can get stuff up at lunchtime or early afternoon, you’re going to get more hits. So, there’s kind of time thing there, and a lot of stuff we do is very quick,  we don’t have a lot of time to do stories. We don’t really spend ages doing stuff, whereas traditionally data journalism does spend a long time doing stuff. We don’t do that, we do things as quickly as humanly possible. But then what we do is we open up the data set and people can take it and do things in a better way. So there’s a lot of faffing around with the data, making it work properly, getting rid of all those merged columns and getting it to do what you want it to do. When you’re at that point, you can start looking at it and thinking what does this show us, what does this tell us — and that’s when it gets really interesting, when you can visualize it and make it work for you.</p>\\n<p>Then what we do is ask “What are we going to do with this?” Is it going to be interesting as a story? Is it going to work best as a graphic or visualization? The great thing about data journalism is it’s such a versatile format — what you do can end up in so many different results. You could just be printing the numbers, or you could be printing lots of things much different than that. It’s what makes it interesting — what you produce can be anything from a story to a visualization, an animation to anything else from that. Once we’ve done that, we kind of concentrate on getting stuff up and out there. But that’s not the end of it because being the Guardian, it’s very much an open organisation and we will try to put stuff out as much as possible on social media, Twitter, Tumblr, so on, see what people can do with it, and see what they like about it, what they don’t like about it and so on. So we try to make it a live process, where we respond to people as well.</p>\\n<p>Q: How does the Data Store make use social media?</p>\\n<p>A: We do it partly because they’re all traffic drivers — we often get about 50% of our traffic via Twitter, for instance. So it really works for us because less people use the front page and it’s really  hard to get stuff on the front page; if you can’t do that, how are people going to find what you’re doing? So we rely quite a lot on social media, and some things do really, really well on social media without ever having being near the front page — the other day, we reproduced a graphic from the 1920s showing what people though life would be like in the 1950s, and it didn’t go anywhere near the front page until it started doing really, really well. So that stuff really matters for us. We’ve recently started doing a lot of stuff on Tumblr and Facebook, which at the moment because we haven’t been doing it that long, we don’t know how it’s going to go. But that could work out really interestingly, we just have to see what happens with that. That kind of thing, the increasing of that, is where people are going to share. Stuff going viral by word of mouth, that really matters for people. That’s what’s really interesting to us there.</p>\\n<p>Q: That community often feeds back with new content; how often does that community help produce new visualizations or other content?</p>\\n<p>A: It really varies; if you look at the comment field, some things do really well — we did the poverty map of England and it got 300 comments in about half a day. That’s one instance where feeding back into the visualizations, people take a bit longer. There’s only about 1400 active members of the Flickr group, but they are pretty active — they’ll normally post one or two things a day there. So it really varies, but I’ve noticed the frequency of stuff has increased over time.</p>\\n<p>Q: Talking a bit more about some of the Data Store’s outside contributors, what are some of the risk and rewards of having outside contributors?</p>\\n<p>A: I guess it can be risky, but newspapers have always used columnists and people who don’t work for them to write. There’s no difference in having somebody visualize something for you, who doesn’t work for you. What you often get are new takes and new ways of seeing things you wouldn’t normally get otherwise. You have to make sure stuff’s right, or if it’s not right you do stuff about it — that’s always a risk. We had somebody the other day we had to correct, because it wasn’t adequately sourced, and that happens sometimes. But it’s a risk worth taking because you get associated with being the place to see that kind of stuff.</p>\\n<p>Q: In terms of the positioning of the Data Store in the broader context of the Guardian’s newsroom and workflow, how would you describe it? Are you more of an island or more integrated into the overall workflow?</p>\\n<p>A: It’s really important that we’re part of the workflow of the paper as a whole. We sit on the news desk, we work closely with the news editors to suggest stories, we’ll see things they missed and so on. It’s really an interesting thing for us to be in our place. If we were too isolated, it’d be quite easy to just put your head down and worry about the latest scraper you’re working on, but it’s really much more important to be part of the routine of the desk. So now when people are, say, discussing the budget next week, other people will kind of just make sure we’re included in them, which I’m really pleased about, because that’s how it should be.</p>\\n<p>Q: How do other journalists in the newsroom perceive the work that you do?</p>\\n<p>A: I think before Wikileaks, it was seen as slightly odd — it’s still seen as slightly odd, really — but less-so. I think it’s always with journalists, that as soon as you get a story out of something, then it makes a difference, or as soon as you get content out of something — now increasingly what we do is stuff beyond stories that just does really well on the site — then people can see it’s important. They can see you can add stuff to what they’re doing — often journalists might be faced with a really hideous spreadsheet and they’ll might need help with that. I try not to turn anybody down, probably we all do a bit of that too much, but I think it’s important to be part of that process for as many people as possible.</p>\\n<p>Q: Has there been a movement towards computer-assisted reporting (CAR) and if so, has it been a gradual evolutionary process or more of a faster, revolutionary change?</p>\\n<p>A: I love this thing about definitions we always have to have; we talk about data journalists but also data scientists, data engineers and so on. I think CAR has been going for ages; Heather Brooke has been doing it for ages. What’s interesting now, I think, is how this really has become just part of the process for many people; it’s less unusual than it used to be, it’s less weird. What you have is a few tipping points that have kind of pushed it there — Wikileaks would be one, MPs expenses would be another — not necessarily in terms of what it achieved, but just for the idea that you could do it. Obvious the coverage of the riots was another. So these things add up and they create a whole which is more supportive, more interested in the entire area.</p>\\n<p>Q: You talked a bit about definitions and how people define things — how do you team members define yourselves? Do they see themselves as journalists, data journalists, data engineers, what?</p>\\n<p>A: Very much as a journalist; that’s my background, James’ background too. We’re reporters, and often what we’re doing is very pure journalism — it’s not colour reporting and all that kind of stuff people enjoy doing. There’s a strong history of people reporting on facts and trying to base on that their work and analysis, and that’s what we’re trying to do. I very much see us as journalists. It’s just journalism that’s changing all the time. </p>\\n<p>Q: In a previous interview, Conrad Quilty-Harper from the Telegraph mentioned the boundary changes map that you and they collaborated somewhat on. How frequently do you collaborate with other other data desks?</p>\\n<p>A: It’s more — I think we’re less… argumentative about stuff. For instance, the Telegraph had this really nice code which put two maps next to each other. So we pinched that, but we credited them for it. I’ve run a post before that Conrad Quilty-Harper wrote for the Telegraph site, some investigative work he did, and we ran that as well and said where it’s from. I think we’re less — obviously we’re a bit competitive in the same way that all journalists are competitive — but I think we’ll also recognize when other people have done good work and try to show that. A lot of the stuff we show on the site are graphics and things that have appeared elsewhere that we like. I’m about to put a post up now that’s graphics from CNN and New York Times and all sorts of people. I think there’s a whole sort of process there that’s interesting for people, that we’re doing much more of.</p>\\n<p>Q: So, how would you characterize your relationship with other data desks?</p>\\n<p>A: It’s quite a small world, people tend to know each other. You tend to know who the other people are because you tend to bump into them at events or conferences or things. It’s such a weird area that people who do it tend to stand out. I think it’s a good thing, it’s much more collaborative. Open journalism is what we’re about, right? This fits in totally with that. That said, the people we collaborate with might not be other journalists, they might be from developer groups or interesting organisations around the world.</p>\\n<p>Q: What part of the job is your favourite?</p>\\n<p>A: When you come across something that nobody else has found, “That is just a good idea, we should just do that,” — I love that aspect. And at the end of it, when you’ve done all the boring stuff and can see what it looks like; when you throw a load of locational data into a [Google] Fusion map and suddenly it creates a pattern that you haven’t seen before, that’s really lovely. That moment of realization that what you’ve got is actually interesting beyond just a number, that actually tells you something about that world — that works for me.</p>\\n<p>Q: On the flip-side of that, what’s your least favourite aspect?</p>\\n<p>A: God, it’s getting stuff out of PDFs; vlookups — I’m quite good at vlookups now, but I hate doing them when you’ve got like 650 departments or constituencies and you’re having to change a third of them. All that boring, kind of making data work together stuff — but it’s part of it, it’s part of the process, and I don’t know if you can improve the tools to make that easier. Google Refine does a lot of that, but I think at the end of the day, you’re going to end up with something that can be quite tedious, but it gets you to a point where you can tell a story you’d never be able to otherwise.</p>\\n<p>Q: How do you see the field of data journalism changing in the immediate future?</p>\\n<p>A: I think what will happen is it will become much more commonplace to the extent that what we do will not be that unusual — everyone will be doing it. And that’s not a bad thing, that’s a good thing. When I started reporting, we didn’t have Internet access; people laughed at the idea of having Internet access on your machine. It wasn’t until 1998 that I worked at a place where we had Internet access all the time. But now can you imagine a journalist not using the Internet? I think it’s just the same process, it will become part what other people do.</p>\\n<p>Q: There seems to be two viewpoints: on one hand, it’s a growing part of what everyone does, and on the other, it’s a specialist skill restricted to those with a particular technical literacy…</p>\\n<p>A: I suppose there’s such a lot of variety within this world; everybody’s not doing the same thing. We republish data, and also, I’m very keen that we do stuff as much as possible so it’s part of the news routine, and gets on the front as much as possible. Whereas other people will spend months doing something, but what they produce will be amazing. The way the New York Times will work for a long time on stuff before they put it out whereas we’ll do stuff really, really quickly, partly because we know it does well with the traffic. It’s an interesting thing.</p>\\n<p>Q: In terms of journalists outside of the data store adopting some of these CAR techniques, how fast do you see that progression going?</p>\\n<p>A: It’s really changed since even last year. I mean, you have Polly Curtis doing Reality Check, essentially she’s doing what we’d call data journalism, but it’s just reporting for her. I think that’s what we’re going to see; I’ve noticed it much more frequently. I mean, we work in an organisation where most people in the office don’t have access to Excel because it’s expensive, so it’s limited, but it’s increasing, especially young reporters coming in and it’s just part of what they do; they don’t see it as anything special.</p>\\n<p>Q: Talking a bit more broadly about other movements surrounding data journalism, how does the open data movement inform the work that you do?</p>\\n<p>A: I suppose it’s been a kind of catalyst for a lot of this stuff. We launched in 2009, just after data.gov was launched, just before data.gov.uk launched, so we’re really very much part of that timing. That’s really interesting for us, and it’s worked out quite well. That’s been lucky, and that’s maybe why we’re as well-known as we are in this field, just the timing. So it’s important to us, but I think it kind of helps you can ring up government departments now and they can’t refuse to give you stuff; very rare that people refuse to give you stuff now. So even during the riots, when we asked for those court records, people just said yes. That there’s a right to this information is really important.</p>\\n<p>Q: Are there any technologies you can see moving more towards the ubiquity that, say, maps now have? Also, how do you see geo stuff evolving into the future?</p>\\n<p>A: I think what we’ll see is much more disaggregated, raw stuff, where you can see stuff at a quite granular level. Especially geo stuff, we’re noticing that. We’re getting bigger data sets that are very, very local. And that’s really good. Certainly we’re in a place where we can do stuff with that.</p>\\n<p>Q: Do you see there being a separation between the print product and the online product in terms of the work that you do? If so, how does that vary?</p>\\n<p>A: I think now we’re very much part of the piece; often a story won’t launch until a data blog post is ready to go with it, which is great. It’s very much part of what we do. Often we’ll say “Get the data online” and also what we do often is product is graphics or visualizations for the paper. The Guardian is a multi-platform product, so we have space on all those platforms. \\t</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"The Evolving Newsroom: Q&A with Simon Rogers\",\"date\":\"May 08, 2012\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"path\":\"content/evolving-newsroom-qa-simon-rogers\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/content-evolving-newsroom-qa-simon-rogers.json\n// module id = 578\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"aendrew.com v8\",\"author\":\"Aendrew Rininsland\"}},\"markdownRemark\":{\"id\":\"/Users/andrew.rininsland/Projects/OTHER/aendrew.github.io/src/pages/2012-06-14-interesting-quote-kenneth-clarkes-leveson-inquiry-testimony/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"html\":\"<p>I found this particularly illuminating:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>I think a lot of the criminal justice legislation of recent years has been a response to popular newspaper complaints. It’s not wholly new, and the popular press have always tended to be--- made a great virtue of ever toughter policies on law and order, and I don’t know a politician who isn’t in favour of tough policies on law and order, but there has been a wave of ever more noisy campaigns, either following high profile criminal cases or whatever, demanding ever tougher sentences from an ever wider range of crimes, to which government and Parliament seems to me to have most readily conceded. </p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Part of what I asked myself when I got back in charge of prisons again, after an interval of 20 years: why do we now have double the prison population? Why are all the sentences longer than they used to be when I was led to believe as a member of the public that crime had actually fallen in the intervening time? Some would say it’s cause and effect, but it plainly is not because the longer sentences are for one type of crime and the fall in crime has been in other types of crime, mainly crime against property which sentences … fall, but not much. The answer is really a series of tabloid newspaper campaigns responded to eagerly by government and Paliament and a series of criminal justice bills.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Actually, it’s quite a lot of my officials and people in the criminal justice system, not just me as a politician, that even the courts respond to this strident demand all the time for ever longer sentencers, ever tougher penalties, and you can see the judiciary and the magistrates, if you like, responding to the criticism they would otherwise come under in individual cases if they don’t keep imposing strict penalties.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Obviously as a polician I disapprove of that. I’m not sure it really does represent a genuine public feeling. There are some people who think you would somehow get rid of crime if you just made the prisons nastier and the sentences longer, but it’s not the prevailing public view, and the newspaper campaigns are usually based on a very, very partial account of some very shocking high-profile case.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>[…]</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>I won’t go back, I’m dilating on again, but I just think the clamour from particular newspapers for tougher and tougher Criminal Justice Acts has been responded to. I think prison requires tens of thousands of people in, they are serious criminals who should be punished severely and need to be put away to stop them committing more crimes, <strong>but I don’t think you should add people who are really an extremely annoying nuisance and people who really you can get them to stop being criminals if you dealth with them in some other way.</strong> Because the prisons are so overcrowded and so difficult to do anything there, <strong>we are steadily toughening up an underclass of criminals who keep going round and round in the cycle, in and out, and I blame the newspapers for that.</strong></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>(Emphasis mine.)</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Interesting quote from Kenneth Clarke's Leveson Inquiry testimony\",\"date\":\"June 14, 2012\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"path\":\"content/interesting-quote-kenneth-clarkes-leveson-inquiry-testimony\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/content-interesting-quote-kenneth-clarkes-leveson-inquiry-testimony.json\n// module id = 579\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"aendrew.com v8\",\"author\":\"Aendrew Rininsland\"}},\"markdownRemark\":{\"id\":\"/Users/andrew.rininsland/Projects/OTHER/aendrew.github.io/src/pages/2012-05-29-about/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"html\":\"<p>This is the blog and portfolio of Ændrew Rininsland, London-based Canadian expat multinerd.</p>\\n<p>I use <a href=\\\"https://plus.google.com/106103742843933159103\\\">Google+</a>.

That means every man, woman and child in London spent over four and a half hours waiting for late buses last year alone.</p>\\n<p>According to Transport for London’s quality of service indicators, excess waiting time (EWT) on TfL’s high frequency routes averaged 57 seconds per passenger journey between January 2011 and 2012. On a whole, roughly one minute per bus might not seem very much — however, it really adds up when multiplied over the 2.3 billion bus journeys made per year alone.<sup id=\\\"fnref-1\\\"><a href=\\\"#fn-1\\\" class=\\\"footnote-ref\\\">1</a></sup></p>\\n<p>“Transport for London operates a fleet of 8,500 buses over 700 routes 364 days of the year,” said a spokesperson for TfL. “It is one of the biggest operations in the UK and Europe.   TfL  monitors the performance of all bus companies contracted to provide services in London.  Contracts are rigorously managed and financial penalties are levied if a bus company is not meeting targets for reasons within their control.  London’s buses generally perform very well.  Where issues are identified however, they are quickly rectified.”    </p>\\n<p>TfL measures bus performance two different ways. On high frequency routes, which run five or more buses per hour, users are less likely to use a timetable and thus EWT is used to measure how long they’ve had to spend waiting because of irregular or non-running buses. Meanwhile, users on low frequency routes are more likely to use a timetable and thus the percentage chance that a bus is running on time is more important.</p>\\n<p>Bus punctuality is most visible in central London, where road construction and rush hour congestion can have a dramatic impact on bus performance. It really is no coincidence that the performance of bus routes increases fairly substantially the further one gets from the city centre. Below, a normalized index has been used to compare the punctuality of both high and low frequency bus routes.</p>\\n<div>\\n          <div\\n            class=\\\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\\\"\\n            style=\\\"padding-bottom: 109.9388379204893%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\\\"\\n          >\\n            <html><head><script type=\\\"text/javascript\\\" src=\\\"http://public.tableausoftware.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js\\\"></script></head><body><div class=\\\"tableauPlaceholder\\\" style=\\\"width:654px; height:719px;\\\"><noscript><a href=\\\"http:&#47;&#47;aendrew.com&#47;content&#47;waiting-tfl-bus-punctuality-transport-londons-network\\\"><img alt=\\\"LONDON BUSES \\\" src=\\\"http:&#47;&#47;public.tableausoftware.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Bu&#47;Busmap_2&#47;BusesMap&#47;1_rss.png\\\" style=\\\"border: none\\\" /></a></noscript><object class=\\\"tableauViz\\\" style=\\\"\\n            position: absolute;\\n            top: 0;\\n            left: 0;\\n            width: 100%;\\n            height: 100%;\\n          \\\"><param name=\\\"host_url\\\" value=\\\"http%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableausoftware.com%2F\\\"><param name=\\\"site_root\\\" value=\\\"\\\"><param name=\\\"name\\\" value=\\\"Busmap_2/BusesMap\\\"><param name=\\\"tabs\\\" value=\\\"no\\\"><param name=\\\"toolbar\\\" value=\\\"yes\\\"><param name=\\\"static_image\\\" value=\\\"http://public.tableausoftware.com/static/images/Bu/Busmap_2/BusesMap/1.png\\\"><param name=\\\"animate_transition\\\" value=\\\"yes\\\"><param name=\\\"display_static_image\\\" value=\\\"yes\\\"><param name=\\\"display_spinner\\\" value=\\\"yes\\\"><param name=\\\"display_overlay\\\" value=\\\"yes\\\"><param name=\\\"display_count\\\" value=\\\"yes\\\"></object></div><div style=\\\"width:654px;height:22px;padding:0px 10px 0px 0px;color:black;font:normal 8pt verdana,helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\\\"><div style=\\\"float:right; padding-right:8px;\\\"><a href=\\\"http://www.tableausoftware.com/public?ref=http://public.tableausoftware.com/views/Busmap_2/BusesMap\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Powered by Tableau</a></div></div></body></html>\\n          </div>\\n          </div>\\n<p>“Street works will have a sharp impact on buses, particularly when they’re ready to be timetabled,” said London TravelWatch policy officer Robert Nichols. “Any road works on the route will have a cumulative effect over the course of the day.

Unfortunately, these are also the areas where lots of events and disruptions are held and these can impact performance.”</p>\\n<p>Of Abellio’s routes, the 414 was the worst high frequency with an average of 1.49 minutes of excess waiting time, followed closely by the 172 with 1.48 minutes. The N35 was the worst low-frequency, with only 68.56% chance of departing on time.</p>\\n<p>“With [the 414 and the 172], it’s quite simply where they traverse,” said the Abellio employee. “Unfortunately, those routes go through some very popular areas, and what’s going on in those areas can have a dire impact on the service. The 414 goes through Fulham Road and Hammersmith, and for the last six months there’s always been roadworks on Fulham Road — that doesn’t help service.” </p>\\n<p>“You also have when Chelsea play at home and the impact it has when thousands of people come to view that — your buses just aren’t going to be on time,” he added.</p>\\n<p>Meanwhile, the 220 (run by London United) was the worst high frequency line in averaging nearly 2 minutes of EWT. The N109 (run by Arriva London) was the worst low frequency route, with an average 68.6% chance of departing on time. Abellio’s 172 had the worst month out of all the high frequency routes, with 2.97 minutes of EWT in March, while Metrobus’ R10 route only had a 29.8% chance of departing on time between 17 September and 14 October.</p>\\n<html><head><script type=\\\"text/javascript\\\" src=\\\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/static/modules/gviz/1.0/chart.js\\\"> {\\\"dataSourceUrl\\\":\\\"//docs.google.com/spreadsheet/tq?key=0Aqqh1cRUSxC-dGYyQlpudTlIanZKUDYtNkxGdlF3M2c&transpose=0&headers=0&range=A1%3AB14&gid=5&pub=1\\\",\\\"options\\\":{\\\"vAxes\\\":[{\\\"useFormatFromData\\\":true,\\\"viewWindowMode\\\":\\\"pretty\\\",\\\"viewWindow\\\":{}},{\\\"useFormatFromData\\\":true,\\\"viewWindowMode\\\":\\\"pretty\\\",\\\"viewWindow\\\":{}}],\\\"series\\\":{\\\"0\\\":{\\\"pointSize\\\":7,\\\"color\\\":\\\"#38761d\\\",\\\"lineWidth\\\":4}},\\\"title\\\":\\\"Average Excess Waiting Time by month\\\",\\\"booleanRole\\\":\\\"certainty\\\",\\\"curveType\\\":\\\"function\\\",\\\"animation\\\":{\\\"duration\\\":500},\\\"lineWidth\\\":2,\\\"hAxis\\\":{\\\"useFormatFromData\\\":true},\\\"width\\\":650,\\\"height\\\":500},\\\"state\\\":{},\\\"chartType\\\":\\\"LineChart\\\",\\\"chartName\\\":\\\"Chart 2\\\"} </script></head><body></body></html>\\n<html><head><script type=\\\"text/javascript\\\" src=\\\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/static/modules/gviz/1.0/chart.js\\\"> {\\\"dataSourceUrl\\\":\\\"//docs.google.com/spreadsheet/tq?key=0Aqqh1cRUSxC-dGYyQlpudTlIanZKUDYtNkxGdlF3M2c&transpose=0&headers=0&range=A1%3AB14&gid=6&pub=1\\\",\\\"options\\\":{\\\"vAxes\\\":[{\\\"useFormatFromData\\\":true,\\\"viewWindowMode\\\":\\\"pretty\\\",\\\"viewWindow\\\":{}},{\\\"useFormatFromData\\\":true,\\\"viewWindowMode\\\":\\\"pretty\\\",\\\"viewWindow\\\":{}}],\\\"series\\\":{\\\"0\\\":{\\\"pointSize\\\":7,\\\"color\\\":\\\"#6aa84f\\\",\\\"lineWidth\\\":4}},\\\"booleanRole\\\":\\\"certainty\\\",\\\"curveType\\\":\\\"function\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"Percentage chance of departing on time by month\\\",\\\"animation\\\":{\\\"duration\\\":500},\\\"lineWidth\\\":2,\\\"hAxis\\\":{\\\"useFormatFromData\\\":true},\\\"width\\\":650,\\\"height\\\":500},\\\"state\\\":{},\\\"chartType\\\":\\\"LineChart\\\",\\\"chartName\\\":\\\"Chart 1\\\"} </script></head><body></body></html>\\n<p>Looking more broadly, the period from 17 September to 14 October was worst for the high frequency bus routes, with 1.09 minutes of EWT. 12 November to 9 December was worst for the low frequencies, with all those routes averaging only a 82.9% chance of departing on time.</p>\\n<p><em>Credit to <a href=\\\"http://dotlinking.blogspot.co.uk/2011/02/mapping-londons-bus-routes.html\\\">dot linking</a> for Tableau TfL route shapes.</em></p>\\n<div class=\\\"footnotes\\\">\\n<hr>\\n<ol>\\n<li id=\\\"fn-1\\\">\\n<p>Note that this assumes the same amount of excess time spent waiting for the roughly half as many low frequency routes, which average an 85% chance of departing on time.

However, the collective 36 million hours stat above is still a very conservative estimate, as a “bus journey” as defined by TfL may involve multiple transfers, and there’s a possibility of EWT each

I then fed this into a Drupal install to make it all fancy and consumable via <a href=\\\"http://festivals.aendrew.com/sparql\\\">RDF/Sparql</a>. <a href=\\\"http://festivals.aendrew.com\\\">Visit the result here.</a> What follows is the article that accompanied it. <!-- more --><html><head></head><body></body></html></p>\\n<hr>\\n<h2>Rainfall at UK music festivals, or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love The Rain</h2>\\n<p>This year’s Isle of Wight festival made the news — but not due to any of its headliners.</p>\\n<p>An unseasonably wet June caused a variety of problems, ranging from flooded tents to the small island being turned into one giant traffic jam after a main parking area was closed on Thursday — ferries were unable to unload their passengers and had to wait in the channel for hours. For some, it appears to have been a miserable time.</p>\\n<p>“When we finally got through the gates on Friday we got to see the last 3 songs of Feeders set,” said ‘joji,’ a user on the Isle of Wight festival forum. “Never again!! Total rip off. Spent most of the weekend bored senseless.”</p>\\n<p>“[I] went to IOW fest in 2002, [it was] well organised, so came back this year due to an awesome lineup,” said ‘alexshep62,’ another forum commenter. “I will not come back next year, and probably never again unless there is a really good lineup.”</p>\\n<p>Others, however, had a much more positive experience. </p>\\n<p>“Everyone [I went with] had such a good time despite the rain,” said first-time festivalgoer Georgina Jamieson, who traveled all the way from Edinburgh. “I fell in the mud, but it only really went on my arm — my sister was laughing at me so hard that she nearly fell in too! This dad and daughter were really sweet, though; they gave me tissue and some water to clean up while I was queuing.”</p>\\n<p>Other commenters on the forums seemed in agreement with Jamieson.</p>\\n<p>“I know some on this forum have complained [about] organization but I felt most everything was carried out timely and without too much hassle,” said ‘chewse,’ a 50 year-old couple who had traveled from Texas for the event. “If I had to choose one thing that dampened our spirit it was the weather on Saturday. We adapted to the mud pretty good (we bought ‘Wellies’ while there) but the rain pouring down while trying to watch Pearl Jam was a bummer.”</p>\\n<p>For both the festivalgoer and the festival planner, weather is one variable that cannot be controlled. Yet even at the same event, one encounters wildly varying experiences — is it all just a matter of opinion? Are some willing to tolerate bad weather more than others? And how much does preparation play into it?</p>\\n<p>Floundering at Field Day</p>\\n<p>When my girlfriend and I attended Field Day this year, two things astonished us. The first was the amount of rain, which started just as headliner Franz Ferdinand went on stage and was so bad that it forced us to abandon the festival early. Walking through what we thought was a torrential downpour while we desperately searched for a bus route that hadn’t been diverted by the Metropolitan Police Service, it dawned on us two Canadian expats that even the rainiest North American festival paled in comparison with what we had just experienced at Field Day. Yet the second thing that surprised us was the amazing tenacity of many British festivalgoers, who kept dancing just as hard in the rain as in sunshine. </p>\\n<p>I would later learn that this year’s Field Day festival was actually the third least rainy of all those festivals thus far — an insignificant 0.41mm, a light drizzle compared to the 4.39mm in 2007. Needless to say, precipitation factors into UK festivals in ways continental events couldn’t even imagine.</p>\\n<p>To better prepare myself for future festivals, I began accumulating data for every major ongoing outdoor festival in the UK.  I then combined it with Met Office historical precipitation data to find which festivals are the rainiest. However, I found that, while rain is often inevitable, what makes the biggest difference is how prepared — both mentally and logistically — everyone is for its presence.</p>\\n<p>The view from backstage</p>\\n<p>Meet Leon Milner, who worked as an artist liaison at this year’s Isle of Wight festival, and as a volunteer organizer at Bestival in 2008 — another incredibly rainy festival. Although he admits working at a festival can often be easier simply just by being able to access quieter, drier areas, that doesn’t change the fact that festival workers still have to be out in sometimes adverse weather whether they like it or not.</p>\\n<p>“There comes a point where you can’t get any more muddy or wet and you just have to get on with it,” he said. “Everyone who works at a festival is linked to someone else; if one part fails, a ripple effect starts. Someone’s late, you’re held up, the band you’re looking after is waiting… Et cetera. </p>\\n<p>“With sunny weather this isn’t really an issue. No one minds waiting in the sun. However, when you’re wet and damp, then time is often amplified. A minute feels like 5 minutes.”</p>\\n<p>Citing humour as his main coping mechanism, Milner notes that adverse weather tends to bring everyone working at festivals closer together.</p>\\n<p>“It can be tough to keep positive and warm during the festival; however, there’s always seems to be a ‘Dunkirk spirit’ with all the staff in the area you’re working in,” he said. “I think during sunny weather there isn’t this closeness. Moments of extreme weather always seem to bring people together.”</p>\\n<p>It’s often not the rain that’s particularly problematic, however, so much as all that comes with it — for Bestival 2008 it was wind, which caused the roof of one stage to collapse (fortunately, it was closed at the time). For Isle of Wight 2012, however, the bigger problem was the mud:</p>\\n<p>“As soon as you have a heavy downpour you get sludge mud. It’s wet, drippy and soaks through everything. Once the sun comes out, you get sticky mud, which clings to boots and makes everything so heavy. After two days of sun, you get hard mud — which, after three days of festival walking, is like walking on concrete.”</p>\\n<p>“The mindset of festival organisers is that the sun will always shine,” he added. “And to be fair, the IoW fest has had many years of glorious sunshine. Unfortunately, 55,000 people all walking on the same bit of mud keeps it churned. Bestival also was unprepared for the heavy rain in 2008, however, now they have spare metal tracking and other assets to use if it does rain. </p>\\n<p>“In short it takes a bad event for a festival to then become prepared. Perhaps it’s a more reactive than proactive mindset that exists.”</p>\\n<p>“… And not a drop to drink.”</p>\\n<p>According to the Met Office, the Isle of Wight generally averages 43.4mm of rain for the month of June, compared with 72.6mm for the UK average. It’s generally pretty dry. However, the Isle of Wight has already seen over 100mm this month alone — double its average for June — and the UK itself is in the midst of some incredibly turbulent weather.</p>\\n<p>“April was the wettest on record, however, March was the fifth driest — we only had about 30% of the normal precipitation we’d expect,” said Dan Williams, a spokesperson for the Met Office. “Looking on a little bit further, this June is going to be one of the wettest on record. Exactly where it’s going to finish is hard to say, but it’s likely going to be top five. It’s competing against 2007, which was the wettest on record.”</p>\\n<p>According to Williams, the fact that the Isle of Wight is generally one of the driest areas in the UK could have possibly played a role in making this year’s rains even more adversarial.</p>\\n<p>“In general, those places that see a lot of rain can cope with a lot of rain because of the way the rainfall runs off,” he said. “There are lots of rivers and valleys and they’re generally pretty mountainous areas. </p>\\n<p>“As a general rule, the wettest places are able to cope with that amount of rainfall or else they would flood all the time, and obviously they don’t. But that doesn’t necessarily mean the driest places couldn’t cope with higher rainfall — the fact is that some places can, some places can’t. Each place will have different thresholds.”</p>\\n<p>Although it’s impossible to predict when an area like the Isle of Wight is going to get an excessive amount of rain like it has this month — and the spastic weather these last few months makes it difficult to say with any certainty what any particular festival will be like — having a sense of how geography contributes to the UK’s weather can be helpful.</p>\\n<p>“The wettest regions are the high ground areas — places like Snowdonia, the lake districts and the highlands of Scotland — all on the west side of the country,” said Williams. “Most of our weather comes in via Atlantic weather fronts from the west. Those high ground areas tend to encourage rainfall, so much of the rain will fall when air masses start to rise, which causes increased condensation and rainfall amounts. </p>\\n<p>“Snowdonia, Cumbria and the far northwest of the UK are always the wettest places on average throughout the year. The driest places are the other side of the country for exactly the same reasons — all of that weather comes in from the west, tends to unload on the higher ground, and when it reaches the far south east, a lot of that rain has rained itself out, so you get less in general. I’d say the driest places are around the Thames estuary, for example — Essex, Suffolk and Kent. The south coast of England as well; all the way along, though apparently not the Isle of Wight at the moment!”</p>\\n<p>Given this, southeastern England seems like the ideal part of the country to hold music festivals. But what about when?</p>\\n<p>“Meteorologically, summer for us is June, July and August,” said Williams. “Average rainfall for the UK for June is 72.6mm, July is 69.6mm and August is 89.6mm. Based on that, if you were planning to hold a festival, you’d probably aim for July.”\\nGlastonbury or bust</p>\\n<p>Ben Taylor, guitarist for rockabilly band Scale Electric Drive-by, has been going to music festivals since he was a young child. He recalls many rainy festivals, with Glastonbury in 1997 and 1998 topping his list as the most memorable.</p>\\n<p>With stories ranging from his dad nearly being crushed by two tractors pulling his truck up the hill at Glastonbury one year, to the next year just narrowly missing being covered head-to-toe in human excrement when a pump truck attempting to clear out a dance tent accidentally had its vacuum in reverse, Taylor’s seen it all. His advice to festivalgoers is to be prepared for anything and everything.</p>\\n<p>“Make sure your tent is waterproof — that’s a big one,” he said. “Often people make the mistake of thinking their tents are more waterproof than they actually are. </p>\\n<p>“Definitely bring an extra ground mat. Essentials are ponchos, Wellingtons, waterproof jackets, a good change of clothes, changes of socks — you have to have loads of them, because they’re going to get wrecked. Don’t bring anything you like!”</p>\\n<p>He also advises to ensure that the front of your tent is closed at all times, and especially before heading to any of the stages — a mistake he himself made at last year’s Reading festival. </p>\\n<p>“The weather can start off alright — you leave it open, you have a couple drinks and go off somewhere… But everything happens in an instant,” he said.</p>\\n<p>He also advises festivalgoers to bring two sleeping bags, with one left in the vehicle in case of emergencies.</p>\\n<p>“I went to a rockabilly festival quite recently and it rained the whole time we were there,” he explained. “My tent was sealed up, but I went to my tent in the evening and everything was soaked, it came from the ground up. Having an extra sleeping bag meant that I didn’t sleep in water that night.”</p>\\n<p>However, his biggest piece of advice is in terms of attitude:</p>\\n<p>“If you go to a festival and let the weather get you down, you’re there for the wrong reasons. You prepare yourself by knowing what the weather is going to be. Anyone going to a festival is going to look up the weather for while they’re there — you’d be foolish not to.”\\nWhen Wellies are mandatory</p>\\n<p>That’s easy to say for a die-hard like him, but what about the rest of us? Although it’s true rainfall shouldn’t have an effect on which festivals you plan to go to, one can rely on weather reports only so much. And while there’s only so much one can do when weather is as abnormally wet as it is this month, having an idea of how a festival has been in the past can give some clues whether to pack rubber boots, sunscreen — or both.</p>\\n<p>Of all the UK music festivals, the one with the most consistent rain was the Belladrum festival (formerly Tartan Heart festival), which has received 4.3mm of rain on average every day of its existence. Situated in the northern Scotland highlands, the festival is geographically located in the centre of one of the UK’s rainiest areas. How do they deal with the rain?</p>\\n<p>“It’s usually quite warm for us, the wet doesn’t seem to bother our patrons — other than when it is exceptionally rainy, as it was last year,” said a spokesperson for the event. “However, we are continuously upgrading drainage and permanent tracks and always advise people to come well prepared for any weather conditions.” </p>\\n<p>“We also have contingency measures in place to use stage tents as shelter in emergency and the Red Cross attends with access to emergency blankets, heaters, et cetera,” he added.</p>\\n<p>Belladrum festival is followed by Rewind and Latitude festivals, which receive 3.6mm and 3.4mm on average per day, respectively.</p>\\n<p>In terms of the rainiest festival ever, V Festival Chelmsford 2010 received a whopping 14.32mm of rain a day. Comparatively, Fairport’s Cropredy Convention 1982 came in second with 12.84mm and Reading 1982 came in third with 12.51mm. The epically-rainy Glastonbury festivals mentioned by Ben Taylor don’t even place in the top 25, while Bestival 2008 mentioned by Leon Milner came in at 17th (The HadleyUKP dataset, from which I’ve derived historical festival data, won’t be updated until the end of the month. However, another source says that the Isle of Wight received nearly 16mm of rain on the Thursday before the festival, which is quite a lot compared to other festivals historically, but far less dramatic when averaged out over the next few days.).</p>\\n<p>Another way I analyzed festival weather was by calculating what percentage of festival days had rain greater than 1mm. Belladrum festival placed in the top 3 again with 88%, however, it was beaten by Sonisphere and Latitude festivals, neither of which have had a single day in their history without rain (Hint: it’s probably a safe bet to bring your Wellies to any of these.). Meanwhile, the rain at this year’s Isle of Wight festival pushed it from the driest of all festivals (With rain on only 18% of all festival days) to second driest, with rain on 28% of the days the festival has run. As a result, Underage festival in London is now the driest of all.</p>\\n<p>Will any of this help you stay dry, even if you pack all your wet weather gear, two sleeping bags, more pairs of socks than you can shake a stick at and a tent that could survive in the Amazon? Probably not, but knowing what to expect is half the battle to learning how to stop worrying and love the rain – after all, you can either fear the damp and not go to anything, or take it in stride and see it merely as something making this year’s festivals that much more memorable.</p>\\n<p>Isle of Wight festival was contacted but refused comment. </p>\\n<h3>Annex I: Technical discussion</h3>\\n<p>As mentioned in my story, the idea for this project originated when my girlfriend and I were rained out of a festival earlier this year. </p>\\n<p>Not only was it not that bad of a storm, but the festival was within an hour’s bus ride from home and involved no camping. I myself have gone to plenty of festivals in western Canada, some stationed in the middle of the Rocky Mountains and involving nearly a week of being outdoors — although the case can certainly be made that we were either unprepared or just wimped out, I nevertheless started wondering how festivalgoers in the UK are able to enjoy outdoor festivals given both the capacity and probability of rain here.</p>\\n<p>The idea really started to take shape, however, when pictures started circulating of this year’s Download festival, showing tents that were completely flooded, and a campground that looked more like a swimming pool than its original intention. When it turned out those photos were from an earlier Glastonbury festival (Download was really rainy but not flooded out, it later emerged), I decided that it might be multifactor — yes, watching music in the rain isn’t the most fun, but the whole thing becomes somewhat unfeasible once your sleeping space becomes absolutely drenched. To this end, I figured it would be interesting to find which festivals got it worst for rain, using historical weather data from the Met Office. On one hand, it could be used to compare this year’s events to ones that have been famously wet, giving a broader picture of how the weather this year compares to others. On the other hand, however, it could perhaps be used in a predictive capacity — if readers are aware that some festivals are rainy 100% of the time, they may be more inclined to better prepare for them. With the recent rain issues at the Isle of Wight festival, I was given a recent news angle to pursue.</p>\\n<p>When I started this project, I honestly thought it would be a lot easier to collect the necessary data than it actually was. Considering how popular these festivals are, I figured there had to be a table somewhere I could scrape, or — better yet — a semantic web resource I could query, that would give me at least the dates and locations of all the festivals I was wanting to include in my project. </p>\\n<p>This, however, was not the case.</p>\\n<p>The most definitive resource I could find for a lot of the major festivals was eFestivals.co.uk (festival-submitted listings of events — highly accurate but only going back to 2001), followed by Wikipedia (itself incomplete and inconsistently formatted — I actually ended up editing and expanding a lot of entries as I continued my research). After querying Stack Overflow about whether such specifics exist somewhere as linked data, it was suggested I build my own data set and release it as a semantic web resource. As a firm proponent of the semantic web and open data — and because I was building this dataset anyway — I felt that aggregating all that data and releasing it as such would not only enable me to do some interesting things with my project, but also allow anyone undertaking similar research to do so much more effectively. </p>\\n<p>To that end, I started aggregating the locations and dates of the major festivals, going all the way back to their origins. For a large number of festivals occurring before 2000, I had to search through Nexus to find news reports or reviews about the festival, the dates of which I then added to my dataset. This alone took the majority of my data-crunching time, and is accessible as a spreadsheet on Google Drive.  </p>\\n<p>After completing that, I then imported all 450-odd records into a new Drupal installation, which I decided to use due to its superior ability to not only render content, but also to enable its use as semantic web constructs. This enabled me to conform my data to Schema.org’s MusicEvent and Festival taxonomies, resulting in an expansive resource that can be queried though the site’s own SPARQL endpoint. While 99% of people encountering that aspect won’t know what to do with it, any data journalist or coder wanting the ability to mashup my data with something else can very easily do so, making my project something that ultimately enriches the field.</p>\\n<p>This ability to mashup my data can be seen with the ease that I did so with two different datasets from the Met Office — the Hadley Centre’s HadUKP and HadCET sets. The one most relevant to my project was HadUKP, which charts precipitation in 8 different regions of the UK and is updated monthly (unfortunately, this means festivals this June won’t have data until the end of the month — that said, as in the case of Isle of Wight, I tried to find alternate data elsewhere in the meantime). HadCET is an aggregate measure of air temperature from various parts of the UK and I used it in some charts mainly as a very broad indicator of what the overall UK climate was like during that season (given its variability as a result of its methodology, I didn’t think it appropriate to focus too much on it.). Both of these are now easily accessible to the broader Internet through the two scrapers I’ve built at Scraperwiki, letting other journalists and coders much more easily use that data. I also created a Google Map defining the 8 regions of the HadUKP dataset and enabling me to use geolocation to find out which region any particular festival is in.</p>\\n<p>All of this was joined to the Drupal site through the Google Chart API (and a lot of PHP code), the results of which can be seen on any individual event page, an event taxonomy page or a number of aggregate charts I’ve listed below.</p>\\n<p>At this stage, I had a very complete picture of which were the rainiest festivals in the UK — down to the year — and which were the driest. I used this information when gathering interviews and to rank these festivals in relation to these topics.</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"MA Project: Rainfall at UK music festivals\",\"date\":\"July 08, 2012\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"path\":\"content/ma-project-rainfall-uk-music-festivals\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/content-ma-project-rainfall-uk-music-festivals.json\n// module id = 583\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"aendrew.com v8\",\"author\":\"Aendrew Rininsland\"}},\"markdownRemark\":{\"id\":\"/Users/andrew.rininsland/Projects/OTHER/aendrew.github.io/src/pages/2012-11-04-economist-sinodependency-treemap/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"html\":\"<p>For another treemap I did for <a href=\\\"http://www.economist.com\\\">The Economist</a>, I mapped dependency of how exposed various S&#x26;P500 companies are to declining investment in China.</p>\\n<p>See: <a href=\\\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2012/09/sinodependency-index\\\">http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2012/09/sinodependency-index</a></p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Economist: Sinodependency Treemap\",\"date\":\"November 04, 2012\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"path\":\"content/economist-sinodependency-treemap\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/content-economist-sinodependency-treemap.json\n// module id = 584\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"aendrew.com v8\",\"author\":\"Aendrew Rininsland\"}},\"markdownRemark\":{\"id\":\"/Users/andrew.rininsland/Projects/OTHER/aendrew.github.io/src/pages/2013-01-15-new-project-drupalinstallerkdapp/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"html\":\"<p>Use <a href=\\\"http://www.koding.com\\\">Koding.com</a>?

This is admittedly\\na bit of a departure from how I’ve previously done things — I’ve always been\\nquite the server-side nerd, starting when I learned PHP in tenth grade — but so\\nfar I’m rather enjoying it. This marks the fifth iteration of the site, and I\\nhope that I can finally focus more on posting content than on keeping\\nDrupal modules updated.</p>\\n<p>Why the move?</p>\\n<p>Drupal is a nightmare to keep updated. While this is common amongst server-side\\nopen source content management systems, Drupal’s focus on small and modular\\nbits of functionality means keeping a site up-to-date with the latest contrib\\ncode is somewhat of a challenge. And for a site I update maybe three or four\\ntimes a year, the likelihood of having out-of-date code online is rather high.</p>\\n<p>That’d be the main reason, beyond the fact I never really needed the raw power\\nthat Drupal was able to provide.

It’s this feeling as if everything is so intrinsically flush with meaning, and that one can reach out and pull that towards your being, grab it and clench it to your chest; that you can consume an entire city merely by that desire to understand it. To lie content, nestled in the warm embrace of one’s environs.</p>\\n<p>I think the first time this possessed me was traveling to Saskatoon for a coding competition when I was in grade ten. Two of the classmates in the room had already fallen asleep; the other was playing Diablo on a laptop. For some reason though, I couldn’t sleep; the unremitting pressure of the excitement I felt, of the newness of that place and being, of the unease of that expanse of lights glittering beneath me — it all impacted me in some incredibly hard to describe way. I was young, and the future seemed so confusing and foreign, yet comforting in its complexity, its potential. I wasn’t at all sure what I should be, or even wanted to be, or even why I might want to be anything. At the same time, however, that limitless void of unknowing energised me; it pushed me to want to find that place I may eventually end up.</p>\\n<p>This emotion I’m very poorly attempting to describe hits me quite often when I’m about to land in a city, and I’m excited or awake enough to bother looking out the window. Once you’re about to land somewhere, the bleakness of those hours in the sky gives way to an eventual compromise; barren but still slightly populated city space. Very soon thereafter, that space becomes more dense, and the becomes suburbs; then, urban areas — where once the extent of your vision might have had a few dozen people occupying it, a single gaze now comprises the day-to-day environment of literally thousands — if not millions — of people. You near the airport, and that soup swallows you whole.</p>\\n<p>In my recent life I’ve looked out across much brighter and greater cityscapes than the one offered by Saskatoon. And it saddens me to some degree that I encounter this feeling far less often than I’d like to admit. Maybe I’ve just successfully transitioned from a kid from a small town into a bonafide city dweller, I’m really not sure. But I do know for certain, the meaning that I sculpt out for myself from this particular era of human history is inherently linked to these colossal beasts in which we lurk, in whose bellies we build all the great buildings and think all the great thinkings and believe all the greatest beliefs. Even if we can’t ever understand it all, or even make sense of the tiniest fragment, so much of what it means to be alive has to do with participating in this collective exertion we find ourselves inevitably striving for.</p>\\n<p>-Æ.</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"One of very many voids\",\"date\":\"May 19, 2017\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"path\":\"content/very-many-voids\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/content-very-many-voids.json\n// module id = 594\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"aendrew.com v8\",\"author\":\"Aendrew Rininsland\"}},\"markdownRemark\":{\"id\":\"/Users/andrew.rininsland/Projects/OTHER/aendrew.github.io/src/pages/2017-04-24-some-thoughts-on-memory-the-internet-turning-30/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"html\":\"<p>It’s been an astonishingly long time since I wrote a personal blog entry. I think in between moving to London, getting my degree and then getting a job, my whole habit of journaling and blogging has fallen off a cliff entirely. This is perhaps best expressed by the fact the “most recent” entry on this site is a blog post I wrote three years ago, cataloging some of the things I did during my first year at The Times and Sunday Times.</p>\\n<p>This is the first post in my new, “v8” version of aendrew.com. It’s also the first blog post I’ve written since turning thirty, since moving flat like four times, since changing jobs, since leaving one relationship and entering another. It feels like an unbelievable lot has happened to me since moving to London, most of which seems like an eternity ago. Perhaps restructuring my web properties has contributed to my suddenly feeling this way; perhaps also it has something to do with finally not having a book I need to be working on for the first time in roughly two years.</p>\\n<p>I call this “v8” of the website because my web presence has changed dramatically since I published my first website in 1997. For the sake of posterity, here are various personal websites I’ve built throughout my life. Please be forewarned that most of these are utterly terrible, and reading the content somewhat chronicles my journey from naïve small town child, to gratingly “woke” small town high-school student, to the largely-ambivalent and semi-creative semi-adult I am now.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>v1: <a href=\\\"http://web.archive.org/web/19971011040044/http://www3.sk.sympatico.ca/rininv\\\">Rinin’s Land (1997)</a></li>\\n<li>v2: <a href=\\\"http://web.archive.org/web/20030808012545/http://www.hairysquid.net\\\">hairysquid.net (2003)</a></li>\\n<li>v3: <a href=\\\"http://web.archive.org/web/20051222150742/http://www.hairysquid.net\\\">hairysquid.net mk.II (2004)</a></li>\\n<li>v4: <a href=\\\"http://web.archive.org/web/20090727115029/http://www.begin.hairysquid.net:80/\\\">begin.hairysquid.net (2008)</a></li>\\n<li>v5: <a href=\\\"http://web.archive.org/web/20090213083934/aendrew.com\\\">aendrew.com (2009)</a></li>\\n<li>v6: <a href=\\\"http://web.archive.org/web/20121108072537/http://aendrew.com:80/\\\">aendrew.com mk.II (2011)</a></li>\\n<li>v7: <a href=\\\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161021144952/http://aendrew.com\\\">aendrew.com mk.III (2013)</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>All of the above would be lost in the sands of time to bitrot were it not for the valiant efforts of Archive.org, who have the sisyphian task of trying to snapshot the Internet over time.
