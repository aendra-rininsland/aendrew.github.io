Would be breaking even if weren’t reinvesting at current pace.</li>\n<li>People actually contributing journalistic content is a really small number.</li>\n<li>“80/20 rule is actually 99/1 when it comes to useful content.” — Web 2.0 is a myth.</li>\n<li>Very few people actually interested in newsgathering. </li>\n<li>Built network by a lot of reaching out to groups like local camera clubs.</li>\n<li>“The way you go out and build your community in the beginning is how your community will be forever.”</li>\n<li>\n<p>Example of Digg:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Used to be really cutting-edge stuff; lost their original users. Became free for all and lost its actual value.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Demotix, going for a specific demographic, has retained its user base.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>One of its competitors (Citizen Site) sought to grow user base as much as possible and while they get the occasional good scoop, it’s not as consistent.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>That said, they’re doing some interesting gamification stuff.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Gamification: “Web gurus treat human beings as children — and are right to do so.”</li>\n<li>Temptation to use internal stats to gamify content filtering process, but feeling is it cheapens the process of journalism.</li>\n<li>Worries about faked content. Happens to everyone and would be brutally bad if done early on. Use metadata and calling to verify.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Balance between speed and quality. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quality of photojournalism has vastly improved over the last decade or so, with everyone taking photos.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Storyful: “opposite of Demotix” in approach. Acts as breaking story news curation service.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Both pushes highly-shared stories to the front as well as verifies the content.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>No way around using humans for news</li>\n<li>Contributors everywhere except Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa</li>\n<li>\n<p>Important points for communities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improving that communities news</li>\n<li>\n<p>Learning how to engage that community is very important</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Community is who will decide your front page. Off-site, will write your content.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Questions to audience:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>How has the relationship between journalist and audience changed?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pew: “Views of the News Media 1985-2011”</li>\n<li>Content quality has decreased</li>\n<li>Culture of deference has lessened</li>\n<li>Simultaneously adds new voices but decrease of trust in accuracy makes everything relative; what is true?</li>\n<li>Liveblogging as a direct result of citizen journalism: “article without the stitching” due to the realization readers can “do the stitching themselves.”</li>\n<li>“Downside is we have nobody to trust.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How does a community impact the way in which you create news?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To drive engagement, repeat visits, etc.</li>\n<li>Newspapers start from a negative position — inaccurate, partisan and influenced. The community is those readers who have overcome that.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What is UGC good/bad at?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Good at: news sourcing, accuracy, trust, speed, data crunching, content</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bad at: access, investigative work, writing = “lowest common denominator journalism”</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>“You cannot do citizen journalism without a professional journalism lead.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The job of professional journalists now is to learn to manage these networks as effectively as possible.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Seymour Hersh at the New Yorker cannot be replaced by UGC — he has relationships, time/funding, exceptionally difficult work, verification. Writes 10,000 word articles that are read. </li>\n<li>Hackgate is another example of something that couldn’t be discovered by UGC.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What are the implications for journalism? Can UGC address some of the bigger blindspots in journalism? What is the next phase?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Shift in trust from professionalism to authenticity. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>“From Encyclopaedia Britannica to Wikipedia.”</li>\n<li>Things better managed as communities will become communities (i.e., Craigslist). Things that need unique curation and authority will continue to be run by journalists.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How do you sell truth?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stories are now “collections of subjectivities.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Follow Turi Munthe on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/turimunthe">@turimunthe</a>.</em></p>',frontmatter:{title:"Speaker: Turi Munthe, Demotix",date:"November 16, 2011"}}},pathContext:{path:"content/speaker-turi-munthe-demotix"}}}});
