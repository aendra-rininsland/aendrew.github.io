<h1>Confidentiality/Privacy</h1>

<h2>Major cases</h2>

<ul>
<li>Douglas v. Hallo (2000)

<ul>
<li>Wedding between Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas. Had sold rights to Ok magazine; rival Hallo had photographer who surreptitiously took photos as part of wedding party. Douglases sued for breach of confidence; court upheld the right of the Douglases to protect their wedding. Court argued law of privacy would uphold law of confidentiality; duty of confidentiality didn&rsquo;t need to be identified. Setting was private, info had a commercial value &mdash; injunction would be granted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Theakston v. MGN Ltd (2002): photographs

<ul>
<li>TV star visited brothel; story was told about exploits. Injunction sought, not granted about an account of what happened, though injunction granted against photographs being published.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Photographs can be particularly intrusive, particularly if not done with consent.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Peck v. UK (2003): privacy in a public place

<ul>
<li>Person tried to commit suicide, picture being prevented given to media, ECHR came down on his side and the council had acted inappropriately in providing photos to media.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Princess Caroline von Hannover v. Germany (2004)

<ul>
<li>Argued pictures taken of her were not of public interest and she was being harassed. ECHR came down on Princess Caroline von Hannover&rsquo;s side.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Naomi Campbell v. MGN Ltd (2004) (<strong>the</strong> major case re: privacy)

<ul>
<li>Campbell sued over report in Daily Mirror talking about her treatments for drug addiction. Report showed a photo of her leaving therapy session and gave details about therapy; frequency of therapy. Went to House of Lords, which came down 3-2 in favour of Campbell saying it was acceptable to publish details of drug treatment and to say she had a drug problem, but not acceptable to say she was going to Narcotics Anonymous, or where the treatment, or the kind of treatment; also, unacceptable to show photos of her leaving Narcotics Anonymous. Termed &ldquo;Wrongful disclosure of private information&rdquo;. Looks at the following:

<ol type="a">
<li> Is it private information?</li>
<li> If disclosure took place, would it cause substantial offence to a reasonable person?</li>
<li> What are the benefits of disclosure?</li>
<li> Where does the public interest lie?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Lady Justice Hale: distinction being made between coming out from treatment or going about their normal business.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>McKennitt v. Ash (2005)

<ul>
<li>Brought privacy to another level; a Canadian singer (Lorraine McKennitt) had book written about her by friend. Discussed things only a friend would be aware of.</li>
<li>Court sided with McKennitt; argued she was entitled to protect this information and friend didn&rsquo;t have right to publish it. In judgement itself, not made clear what was true or not; court said it wasn&rsquo;t for the claimant to sift through information to discriminate against what is true or not as that would undermine privacy further.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Murray v. Big Pictures (2008)

<ul>
<li>JK Rowling followed around Edinburgh with child in a pram; injunction sought to prevent photographs to pursue her.</li>
<li>Court granted, arguing special protection granted to children.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Max Mosley v. News Group Newspapers Ltd (2008)

<ul>
<li>Sued over NOTW articles suggesting he had been involved in Nazi-themed sex parties.</li>
<li>Judge came down arguing on the facts that there wasn&rsquo;t evidence the party was Nazi themed. If it was, there would be public interest.</li>
<li>Mosley then argued to the ECHR he should be aware of articles coming out about him, but ECHR argued he didn&rsquo;t have a right to be able to step in an attempt to stop publication. No right for claimant to be told about matter relating to privacy prior to publication.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>LNS v. Persons Unknown (2010)

<ul>
<li>Footballer (John Terry) tried to create a blanket injunction about an affair. Came down against Terry, arguing he was doing this only to protect commercial interests.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Super injunctions

<ul>
<li>Trafigura v. Guardian Newspapers

<ul>
<li>Guardian had info re: Trafigura&rsquo;s toxic waste. Court imposed injunction on publication, but also on publication of information about injunction.</li>
<li>MP argued there shouldn&rsquo;t be a superinjunction; injunction unraveled and information because public.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ferdinand v. MGN Ltd (2011)

<ul>
<li>Rio brought a case against Mirror; Mirror had published details about an affair. Judge Nichol came down on side of newspaper.

<ul>
<li>Ferdinand was the head of English football team; had tried to establish reputation as a reformed character (even having written an autobiography); lady had a right to tell story.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Spelman v. Express Newspapers Ltd

<ul>
<li>Newspaper got paper about rugby player (son of MP) had been ordering illegal performance enhancing drugs. Injunction initially granted then revoked; argued info was in the public domain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Princess Caroline von Hannover (2012)</p>

<ul>
<li>Case showed her and her family walking through the streets of Monaco with father, Prince Rainier, who had been ill. Law came down on side of press, arguing showing a reigning monarch in recovery was in the public interest.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Human Rights Act §12(3)</p>

<ul>
<li>No injunction should be granted unless applicant is likely to win its case.</li>
<li>Media has to be given notice of applicantions</li>
<li>Much lower test than in libel (I.e., Bonnard v. Perryman), where it would be granted only if applicant is able to establish the falsity of the claims.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h1>The Right to Life</h1>

<ul>
<li>Article 2 &mdash; Everyone&rsquo;s right to life should be protected by law. Everyone&rsquo;s life should be protected by the law, except in the case of capital punishment.

<ul>
<li>An absolute right; not a qualified right in the sense it isn&rsquo;t balanced with another right. &ldquo;Trumps all.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Venables and Thompson v. News Group Newspapers Ltd (2001)

<ul>
<li>Two youths found guilty in murder of a young boy. Question was if identifiable after release; court was asked to prevent injunction after they reach age of majority in order to protect right to life. Courts came down in favour of individuals; Art. 2 allowed courts to grant injunction preventing identification ever.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Maxine Carr v. News Group Newspapers Ltd (2004)

<ul>
<li>Involved with a murder case in that she gave a false alibi for her boyfriend. Was granted injunction to prevent her from being identified given she was being sent death threats.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
