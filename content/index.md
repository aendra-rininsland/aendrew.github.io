## Hi!

I'm Ændrew, I'm a London-based journalist currently working at the [Financial Times][1] on the
[interactive journalism team][2] team. I'm also the author of [*D3.js 4.x Data Visualization*][book],
published by Packt Press.

Prior to that, I worked at The Times/Sunday Times and have done work for The Economist and The Guardian.

My interests lean towards computational stuff, though I'm also obsessed with music and visual art.

I do a lot of work in [D3][d3] and [React.js][react]. I've been doing stuff with web technology since the tender
age of [10][3], predominantly in PHP but exclusively in JavaScript the last several years.
