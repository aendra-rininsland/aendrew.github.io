I've recently been playing with the semantic web (for the uninitiated, the semantic web is a structuring of web content in terms of what it depicts instead of just a bunch of linked text files) and have come up with the following two queries -- let me know if you find these useful! For SPARQL (I.e., \[dbpedia\](http://www.dbpedia.org)), the following should return how many competitors each country is sending to the London 2012 Olympics: ~~~ SELECT ?country ?competitors WHERE { ?s foaf:page ?country . ?s rdf:type <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/OlympicResult>. ?s <http://dbpedia.org/property/games> "2012"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#int> . ?s dbpprop:competitors ?competitors } order by desc(?competitors) ~~~ See results by going \[here.\](http://live.dbpedia.org/sparql?default-graph-uri=http%3A%2F%2Fdbpedia.org&query=SELECT+%3Fcountry+%3Fcompetitors+WHERE+%7B%0D%0A%3Fs+foaf%3Apage+%3Fcountry+.+%0D%0A%3Fs+rdf%3Atype+%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fdbpedia.org%2Fontology%2FOlympicResult%3E.%0D%0A%3Fs+%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fdbpedia.org%2Fproperty%2Fgames%3E+%222012%22%5E%5E%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2001%2FXMLSchema%23int%3E+.%0D%0A%3Fs+dbpprop%3Acompetitors+%3Fcompetitors%0D%0A%7D+order+by+desc%28%3Fcompetitors%29&should-sponge=grab-all&format=text%2Fhtml&timeout=0&debug=on) Meanwhile, if you want a MQL query (I.e., \[Freebase\](http://www.freebase.org)), use the following to give a comprehensive array of Golden Raspberry Award "winners": ~~~ query: { "id": "/en/golden\_raspberry\_awards", "type": "/award/award", "category": \[{ "name": null, "name!=" : "Razzie Award for Worst Actor of the Decade", "AND:name!=" : "Razzie Award for Worst Actress of the Decade", "nominees": [{ "year": null, "award\_nominee": [], "nominated\_for": [], "sort": "-year" }], /* nominees */ "winners": [{ "s1:/type/reflect/any\_master" : [{ "type": "/award/award\_winner", "name": null, "key" : [{ "namespace" : "/wikipedia/en", "value": null, "limit": 1 }] /* key */ }], /* award\_winner */ "s2:/type/reflect/any\_master" : [{ "type": "/award/award\_winning\_work", "name": null, }] /* award\_winning\_work */ }] /* winners */ }] /* category */ } /* query */ ~~~ Output [here\](https://api.freebase.com/api/service/mqlread?query={"query":{"id":"/en/golden\_raspberry\_awards","type":"/award/award","category":\[{"name":null,"nominees":[{"year":null,"award\_nominee":[],"nominated\_for":[],"sort":"-year"}],"winners":[{"/type/reflect/any\_master":[{"type":"/award/award\_winning_work","name":null}]}]}]}}). I'll be writing a fairly comprehensive blog tutorial on this sometime in the next few weeks; follow me on [Twitter\](http://www.twitter.com) for updates.
