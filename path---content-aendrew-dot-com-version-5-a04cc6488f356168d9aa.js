This is admittedly\na bit of a departure from how I’ve previously done things — I’ve always been\nquite the server-side nerd, starting when I learned PHP in tenth grade — but so\nfar I’m rather enjoying it. This marks the fifth iteration of the site, and I\nhope that I can finally focus more on posting content than on keeping\nDrupal modules updated.</p>\n<p>Why the move?</p>\n<p>Drupal is a nightmare to keep updated. While this is common amongst server-side\nopen source content management systems, Drupal’s focus on small and modular\nbits of functionality means keeping a site up-to-date with the latest contrib\ncode is somewhat of a challenge. And for a site I update maybe three or four\ntimes a year, the likelihood of having out-of-date code online is rather high.</p>\n<p>That’d be the main reason, beyond the fact I never really needed the raw power\nthat Drupal was able to provide. Yes, I tried making a “resume” content type\nat one point, but it wasn’t any easier to keep maintained than my LinkedIn\naccount or the public Google Doc I sent as a PDF when I was still looking for\nwork.</p>\n<p>Additionally, I’ve started really enjoying the workflow provided by Git,\nparticularly when combiend with the finesse and joie de vivre of GitHub. Not\nonly can I host all my posts for free on GitHub pages, but I also have a great\nway of going back through my work and visualising the changes I’ve made over\ntime. The hope is I can start publishing to my blog more regularly, as well as\nusing it as a place to workshop writing.</p>\n<p>Admittedly the theme needs a bit more work, but it’s nice to be back in\nBootstrap Country.</p>\n<p>I still think aendrew.com itself will always be more of portfolio site while my\n<a href="http://aendrew.tumblr.com">Tumblog</a> will be more bloggy in content, but\nwith any luck I can find the right balance to make both worthwhile.</p>\n<p>-Æ.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"aendrew.com version 5",date:"March 03, 2014"}}},pathContext:{path:"content/aendrew-dot-com-version-5"}}}});
