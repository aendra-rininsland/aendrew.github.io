<div class="entry-content clearfix"><h2>A bit about Demotix&hellip; + Background is politics and freelancing + Desire to create not just a socially-responsible business, but a &ldquo;actively good&rdquo; one + Basic idea was to create a safe platform for anyone wanting to upload stories not being covered. + &ldquo;Free speech as soft power&rdquo; &mdash; led to democratization of regions such as the Middle East. + &ldquo;Mainstream media has been shedding jobs like a 70 year old man sheds hair.&rdquo; + Both foreign correspondents and local reporters are being cut. + Only 4 US newspapers even have a foreign desk. + Even the BBC doesn&rsquo;t have a full-time staffer in Latin America. + This enshrines &ldquo;parachute journalism&rdquo;. + Shallow knowledge of local issue. + Ever-increasing reliance on AP and Reuters for world news. + Ramifications for free speech. + Business model: instead of big networks of volunteers, Demotix receives content, sells it to newspapers and splits the take 50/50. + Launched in 2009; got scoops because of local journalists. + In June of that year, had several journalists in Iran when Ahmadinejad declared himself president after only one round of voting. + London-based sales team, global network of resellers, strategic partnership with Corbis ## &ldquo;What we realized we couldn&rsquo;t do&rdquo; + To build a model on citizen journalism, you have to get content that&rsquo;s sellable. + Text is really difficult 1. Most papers will tell you people can&rsquo;t write 2. Impossible to copyright data; can&rsquo;t sell it as text. + Despite starting as a platform for free speech, platform is mainly used for photo and video. + Good at: bomb fallout, protests, Arab Spring, etc. + Some contributors are able to live off earnings. Would be breaking even if weren&rsquo;t reinvesting at current pace. + People actually contributing journalistic content is a really small number. + &ldquo;80/20 rule is actually 99/1 when it comes to useful content.&rdquo; &mdash; Web 2.0 is a myth. + Very few people actually interested in newsgathering. + Built network by a lot of reaching out to groups like local camera clubs. + &ldquo;The way you go out and build your community in the beginning is how your community will be forever.&rdquo; + Example of Digg: + Used to be really cutting-edge stuff; lost their original users. Became free for all and lost its actual value. + Demotix, going for a specific demographic, has retained its user base. + One of its competitors (Citizen Site) sought to grow user base as much as possible and while they get the occasional good scoop, it&rsquo;s not as consistent. + That said, they&rsquo;re doing some interesting gamification stuff. + Gamification: &ldquo;Web gurus treat human beings as children &mdash; and are right to do so.&rdquo; + Temptation to use internal stats to gamify content filtering process, but feeling is it cheapens the process of journalism. + Worries about faked content. Happens to everyone and would be brutally bad if done early on. Use metadata and calling to verify. + Balance between speed and quality. + Quality of photojournalism has vastly improved over the last decade or so, with everyone taking photos. + Storyful: &ldquo;opposite of Demotix&rdquo; in approach. Acts as breaking story news curation service. + Both pushes highly-shared stories to the front as well as verifies the content. + No way around using humans for news + Contributors everywhere except Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa + Important points for communities: + Improving that communities news + Learning how to engage that community is very important + Community is who will decide your front page. Off-site, will write your content. ## Questions to audience: + How has the relationship between journalist and audience changed? + Pew: &ldquo;Views of the News Media 1985-2011&rdquo; + Content quality has decreased + Culture of deference has lessened + Simultaneously adds new voices but decrease of trust in accuracy makes everything relative; what is true? + Liveblogging as a direct result of citizen journalism: &ldquo;article without the stitching&rdquo; due to the realization readers can &ldquo;do the stitching themselves.&rdquo; + &ldquo;Downside is we have nobody to trust.&rdquo; + How does a community impact the way in which you create news? + To drive engagement, repeat visits, etc. + Newspapers start from a negative position &mdash; inaccurate, partisan and influenced. The community is those readers who have overcome that. + What is UGC good/bad at? + Good at: news sourcing, accuracy, trust, speed, data crunching, content + Bad at: access, investigative work, writing = &ldquo;lowest common denominator journalism&rdquo; + &ldquo;You cannot do citizen journalism without a professional journalism lead.&rdquo; + The job of professional journalists now is to learn to manage these networks as effectively as possible. + Seymour Hersh at the New Yorker cannot be replaced by UGC &mdash; he has relationships, time/funding, exceptionally difficult work, verification. Writes 10,000 word articles that are read. + Hackgate is another example of something that couldn&rsquo;t be discovered by UGC. + What are the implications for journalism? Can UGC address some of the bigger blindspots in journalism? What is the next phase? + Shift in trust from professionalism to authenticity. + &ldquo;From Encyclopaedia Britannica to Wikipedia.&rdquo; + Things better managed as communities will become communities (i.e., Craigslist). Things that need unique curation and authority will continue to be run by journalists. + How do you sell truth? + Stories are now &ldquo;collections of subjectivities.&rdquo; <em>Follow Turi Munthe on Twitter [@turimunthe](<a href="http://twitter.com/turimunthe">http://twitter.com/turimunthe</a>).</em></h2>
