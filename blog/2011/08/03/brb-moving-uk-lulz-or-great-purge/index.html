<p>This blog has admittedly been somewhat inactive the last, well, ever &mdash; but especially so recently given I&rsquo;ve been very much in the process of wrapping things up in Calgary before I move to London (England, not Ontario). If you check this site with any sense of frequency, apologies for how irregular updates have been, but suffice to say I&rsquo;m redoing a lot of how I do web content such that it&rsquo;s much more streamlined in the future, and everything I ever write or post will end up here. As always, I&rsquo;m also available on <a href="http://facebook.com/aendrew">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/aendrew">Twitter</a>.</p>
