        Media Law Lecture -- Contempt of Court

<div class="entry-content clearfix"><h4>Q&rsquo;s for next week: + What is jigsaw identification? + What are the rules on sketching court proceedings? + What is the CPS Media Protocol? + What does the law say about reporters speaking to jurors? + How many jurors in a criminal trial, what number is needed for a majority verdict? + 12; 11/12. Media issue of the week: Lord Chief Justice laying out thoughts on the role of the media (full @ judiciary.gov.uk) + Principle of freedom of press not explicitly stated, but enshrined in various documents. + Free press is important; independent press can be reckless, but important for revealing public scandal. + &ldquo;Crime is crime&rdquo;; if a reporter commits a crime, it should be investigated. + Press Complaints Commission 20 years old; failure to exercise its powers indicative of an understanding of its position. + Comparable to a judge not passing the lengthiest sentence possible in a case. Reading to date: terminology of first module, all the appendices, missed other stuff, need to ask somebody. ## Contempt of Court Act 1981 + Purpose: + Avoid trial by media + Defendant&rsquo;s right to be tried on the evidence + Restricts reporting whilst sub judice + While proceedings are on, there are restrictions on what can be reported. + Protects jurors, defendant. + Open Justice + Justice should be seen to be done, as well as done. + Subject to scrutiny. + Doors of court are open to public. + Allows transparency. + Also part of the European Convention on Human Rights &mdash; right to an public trial, though with qualifications. + Can information be controlled? + Article 6 and 10 European Convention on Human Rights ### The central contempt test + Proceedings active from arrest/issue of warrant for an arrest. + The test: + A publication which creates a substantial risk that the course of justice in the proceedings in question will be seriously impeded or prejudiced. + Strict liability &mdash; intent has little to do with it. + Enforced by the attorney general. + Has to consent to a prosecution against a periodical. + Applies to a **risk** of prejudice, not actual prejudice. + Attorney General v. Express News + Daily Star published photos and names of footballers arrested in rape case despite Attorney General&rsquo;s request + No trial ever carried out, but Daily Star fined £60,000 for *risk* of prejudice. + Attorney General v. MGN Ltd. and News Group Newspapers LTD (2011) + Joana Yates case &mdash; number of publications in Sun and Mirror that focused on Christopher Jeffries, Yates landlord. + Said landlord was peeping tom, has pedophile friend in jail, was obsessed by death, suggested had followed a woman contrary to wishes (immense vilification) + Both found in contempt of court; £18k and £50k fines. Could have prevented people from speaking up, jurors coming to court with an open mind. ### Sanctions: + Fines + Legal costs + Imprisonment + Wasted costs order: S93 Courts Act 2003 + Third Party costs orders + &ldquo;serious misconduct&rdquo; + No need for contempt to be charged; attorney general does not have to give consent, judges can do it themselves. ### Prior to arrest + Common law contempt + Information serious prejudiced proceedings + Intention + Imminent + Rarely prosecuted + AG v. News Group Newspapers (1989) + Printed reports of doctor having raped 18 year old; Sun printed interviews with relatives stating they&rsquo;d start a private prosecution. + Proceedings were imminent; real risk and intention of behalf of publication to muck up proceedings. + Libel &mdash; even if contempt proceedings not brought. + Sexual offense victims have lifelong right to anonymity. Can be waived, but must be in writing. ### When are proceedings active? + Active from: + Arrest + Issue of warrant for arrest + Ends: + By acquittal or sentence + Discontinuance of proceedings + Staggered verdicts (i.e., multiple charges, defendants) + Proceedings are still active and continue until all verdicts reached ### Contempt: factors that may be relevant + The decision maker: jury or judge + After jury has made decision, the judge becomes the decision maker. Latter is less likely to be influenced by TV/media. + Laws under statute are primarily geared towards defending jury. + &ldquo;red alert&rdquo; any time there&rsquo;s a jury. + The impact on potential juror? + Each report looked at separately + What stage of proceedings? + The &ldquo;Fade Factor&rdquo; + Chance of contempt is much more likely when jury is in-situ as opposed to initial arrest. + Further away from trial, less likelihood for contempt. ### Examples of material may be in contempt + Photographs of defendant when ID is an issue + Previous convictions + Bad character + Attorney General v. Associated Newspapers LTD and News Group Newspapers Ltd. (2011) + Vilification of the defendant + Details account of the evidence against the defendant + Details of confessions</h4>
