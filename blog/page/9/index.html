  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>When University of Calgary geoscience professor Dr. Leslie Reid started teaching a decade ago, little did she know what the future had in store for her.</p>

<p>The Tamaratt teaching professor and Project Engage team lead has spent the past five years helping other professors improve their courses and engage with students -things that have contributed to her being awarded a 3M National Teaching Fellowship today in Saskatoon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I actually feel very humbled by the whole process&hellip; . I kind of have this mindset that it&rsquo;s never good enough,&rdquo; said Reid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To have that punctuated with, &lsquo;Hey, what you&rsquo;ve been doing and working on and spending your time and energy on -we recognize that,&rsquo; it&rsquo;s pretty neat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reid is one of 10 Canadian postsecondary professors receiving the award at the annual Society for Teaching and Learning in Higher Education conference. The event is being held this year in Saskatoon.</p>

<p>Since 1986, the fellowships have sought to reward exceptional teaching and learning at Canadian universities.</p>

<p>Reid received the U of C&rsquo;s Tamaratt Teaching Professorship in Geoscience in 2007.</p>

<p>Since then, Reid has focused on improving the educational environment at the U of C for both students and professors alike.</p>

<p>Helping profs evaluate and improve their teaching through initiatives such as the Evolve pilot project, Reid said the most important thing she&rsquo;s learned herself has been to take the time to listen to what students are saying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The greatest lesson I&rsquo;ve learned that has improved my teaching is to listen to students,&rdquo; Reid told the Herald.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sharing the responsibility, the power and the learning with students has allowed me to really use feedback in a meaningful way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In addition to receiving the award, Reid will join the other recipients in Banff this fall for a four-day educational retreat.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Those overwhelmed by everything the Greatest Outdoor Show On Earth has to offer will have an extra tool in their planning arsenal this year, as the Calgary Stampede rolls out its online scheduler.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost impossible to see everything in one day,&rdquo; said Stampede publicity manager Jennifer Booth. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve found that if you plan your Stampede, you have an opportunity to see a little bit more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are so many hidden gems,&rdquo; Booth said. &ldquo;A lot of people do the exact same route every year. We really want to encourage people to try new things out and see some of the different exhibits and attractions that we have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Users will be able to use the online tool to plan an itinerary, buy tickets to events such as the chuckwagon races or Grandstand Show and share plans with friends on Facebook. Several categories of activities are offered, with users also able to search by venue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have more than 180 attractions and events daily on the Stampede grounds, so we really want to make it available to people to plan their Stampede online,&rdquo; said Booth. &ldquo;If visitors want to do a kids&#8217; event, or a family event, or food and beverage, or agriculture -it narrows it down, and it also narrows it down to specific locations, and filters it down to exactly what sort of timelines they would be looking at to do specific activities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The scheduler interfaces with the Stampede&rsquo;s Android and iPhone mobile phone apps and allows users to plan and buy tickets on-the-go -or even on the grounds.</p>

<p>Additionally, those still overwhelmed by the sheer number of choices can text message &ldquo;NEXT&rdquo; to 313131 to receive one of 40 custom-tailored activity suggestions.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>The wet weather on the weekend didn&rsquo;t deter book lovers from attending the 9th annual Calgary Book Drive and Sale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We actually had more people on Saturday than we did on Friday, which is kind of unusual for us,&rdquo; said book drive and sale co-ordinator Andria Brumwell. &ldquo;Our attendance was definitely good; I think last Saturday and Sunday were maybe the best we&rsquo;ve ever had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Held in support of Calgary&rsquo;s Servants Anonymous Society and the Calgary Herald&rsquo;s Raise-a-Reader program, the event has so far raised more than $160,000 in its first weekend. The sale resumes Friday and concludes Sunday.</p>

<p>With new books being put out all the time -and whole trailers of unseen books ready for the sale this coming weekend -Brumwell said that those who&rsquo;ve visited the sale will surely find something new, should they return.</p>

<p>According to book drive and sale volunteer co-ordinator Judy Baldwyn, the restocking process takes several hours on average.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Volunteers normally start at 4 o&#8217;clock cleaning up and making sure the boxes are full,&rdquo; said Baldwyn. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty busy for about three to four hours.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think the book drive and sale has become almost a Calgary institution and people look forward to it every year,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I mentor some students and they&rsquo;re quite excited about coming down here and finding books either for school or just to read over the summer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For volunteer Calvin Lam, the best part about helping is learning new skills and meeting new people.</p>

<p>Lam said he looks forward to introducing younger relatives to comic characters he himself appreciates through items found at the sale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw comics from my generation that probably my younger cousin would really love to watch, like Calvin and Hobbes and Charlie Brown,&rdquo; said Lam.</p>

<p>The sale runs from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. this Friday to Sunday.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Book lovers will get their first chance to dig through pile after pile of interesting novels, reference books, anthologies and other written words as the Calgary Herald&rsquo;s ninth annual Calgary Book Drive and Sale starts Friday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re starting to set up for the sale. It&rsquo;s going pretty well, we&rsquo;ve got a lot of volunteers,&rdquo; said book drive and sale co-ordinator Andria Brumwell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet (how many books were collected in total), but it&rsquo;s more than last year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Recent interesting finds include a book potentially signed by Sir Winston Churchill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The book itself is called Volume 2: Their Finest Hour from a series of volumes on the Second World War,&rdquo; said special books manager Gerry Morgan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The signature is definitely handwritten, it&rsquo;s not printed, and I&rsquo;m going to check it with a signature I&rsquo;ve found online this evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Only days away, the sale is set to take place in the big tent at the Crossroads Market on June 10 to 12 and June 17 to 19, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily.</p>

<p>Contributions from the sale will go to Calgary&rsquo;s Servants Anonymous Society, which provides support and services for victims of sexual exploitation, and Postmedia&rsquo;s Raise-a-Reader program, which aids groups promoting family literacy.</p>

<p>With a colossal array of titles across all genres of books, Brumwell anticipates it will be busy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think people will start lining up around 7 or 8 a.m., depending what the weather does,&rdquo; said Brumwell.</p>

<p>She adds, however, that bargain hunters don&rsquo;t have to endure the elements hours before the sale opens to come across good finds -with 10 trailers of sorted books refreshed each night over the course of the six sale days, both dedicated and casual book lovers should be able to find a stack of summer reading.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know a lot of people think that if they don&rsquo;t come on the first day, everything will be picked over, but that&rsquo;s not true,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got so many in reserve that we put new stuff out all the time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They can find anything they&rsquo;re looking for,&rdquo; added Brumwell.</p>

<p>According to sixth-year volunteer Frieda Aldcroft, it&rsquo;s the books and the people that keep her coming back to help, year after year.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everybody that works here loves books and loves to read. You can tell by the number of books we all buy during the start!&rdquo; said Aldcroft.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very nice camaraderie, especially since we don&rsquo;t see each other except at the book sale -you look forward to it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a nice atmosphere to work in and it&rsquo;s for charity. It makes you feel good inside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fourth-year volunteer Pierrette Lavallee-Hoch agrees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From May until June, it&rsquo;s what we do three days a week,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s every genre of book, for every age of people, and we do resort between the two weekends so there are always new books.&rdquo;</p>

      <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/content/why-i-only-use-dreamhost/">Why I Only Use Dreamhost</a></h1>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p><strong>Another update:</strong> While I&rsquo;m doing increasingly more on Digital Ocean, Amazon Web Services and GitHub Pages for content hosting, I feel I should issue something of a retraction about my last update; Dreamhost seems to have gotten quite a lot better recently. All the projects I do with Citizen Media are hosted on Dreamhost, because their DreamPress managed hosting is really tight — ~$20 per month for managed WordPress hosting. While it&rsquo;s not nearly as &ldquo;managed&rdquo; as, say, WordPress VIP, I effectively never have to worry about server performance for any site hosted as such. The main <a href="http://www.hackneycitizen.co.uk">Hackney Citizen</a> site is hosted as such now, and as traffic for <a href="http://www.eastendreview.co.uk">other</a> <a href="http://www.bestofhackney.com">Citizen-related</a> <a href="http://www.eastendcitizen.co.uk">projects</a> ramps up, they can be easily migrated there.</p>

<p>So, tl;dr — if all you&rsquo;re doing is running WordPress, Dreamhost is still a&#8217;ight.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> After a solid year of nothing but absolutely shit service from Dreamhost across multiple accounts, this blog post is no longer true. I&rsquo;ll write an actual post about my experiences soon, but for the moment — do yourself a favour and steer clear of Dreamhost.</p>

<p>(Also, if anyone has any webhost suggestions, I&rsquo;m all ears &mdash; please post in the comments, thanks!)</p>

<p>Web hosting is always one of those awkward things you have to deal with when building new websites — if the client already has some sort of online presence, they probably have a preexisting business relationship with whoever is hosting their current website, even if that&rsquo;s just a placeholder page. In general, the larger the existing web presence, the more difficult it is to make a client let go of their existing host. In the case of simple, HTML-driven websites, this isn&rsquo;t much of a problem. However, in order to provide a consistent and high quality experience to your visitors, it is absolutely critical to select a high quality webhost if using a server-driven Content Management System (CMS) framework like <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>, <a href="http://joomla.org">Joomla!</a> or <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a>.</p>

<p>Note that this may differ from your domain registrar. While some companies like <a href="http://godaddy.com">GoDaddy</a> use really obnoxious checkout procedures as a way to sucker people into using their mediocre hosting service, often one works with two separate companies, one of which is dealt with once a year (the domain registrar — i.e., at renewal time) while the other entails daily interaction (the webhost). At its most basic level, a CMS is a big collection of server scripts that build a webpage when a user loads it. Say a visitor to your website loads the front page — a bunch of code sends the headers, a bunch more gathers data about whether the user is logged in or not, some more looks up the content that&rsquo;s supposed to be displayed on that particular page, other code renders the layout and design elements, et cetera. While this doesn&rsquo;t necessarily happen every single time a user loads a page — after generating a page, the CMS keeps a copy of it to keep processing overhead down — it happens often enough that server-related issues can push load times past the often-fatal 5 second mark (after which most users will supposedly give up patience).</p>

<p>I have administrated web servers since I was in high school and, trust me, it is both an art and a science. I have also dealt with so many absolutely terrible webhosts that have ultimately cost me money in terms of lost time due to being improperly or poorly configured that it would make your head spin. Because of this, the only company I trust with hosting my work is <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?329024">Dreamhost</a>.</p>

<h1>Here is why:</h1>

<h2>It&rsquo;s cheaper than everyone else</h2>

<p>Just to get it out of the way, using Dreamhost will save you money. I don&rsquo;t know what your current webhost charges you, but it&rsquo;s likely much more than what a comparable plan through Dreamhost will set you back. Their <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/hosting.html">hosting plan</a> has only one package/tier/plan/program and will supply you with all the space, bandwidth, users, emails, databases and domains you could ever ask for. Between all my projects, I&rsquo;m currently hosting 50 domains on a single shared hosting account. While Dreamhost has a <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/hosting-vps.html">Virtual Private Server</a> service, you&rsquo;ll only ever need it if you&rsquo;re serving something that is incredibly memory- or CPU-intensive.</p>

<h2>It&rsquo;s like totally sweet</h2>

<p>Unlimited space. Unlimited email. Unlimited bandwidth. Unlimited domains. Unlimited emails. Unlimited databases. Unlimited announcement and discussion lists. Support for everything under the sun. Easily restore automatically-kept file and database backups with two clicks. And this is just the basic webhosting plan.</p>

<h2>They give you a legit amount of RAM</h2>

<p>A modern CMS will use quite a bit of RAM — I&rsquo;ve seen WordPress and Drupal consume upwards of 50mb per page request with enough plugins/modules. That big chain of scripts that I talked about at the beginning? When it happens, there&rsquo;s a spike in memory usage as the CMS churns through all those functions linked together. If you have a lame webhost that limits your memory usage to something ridiculous like 24mb per process and you&rsquo;re running against your memory limit, one of those functions will tell the next in the chain to fire but it will run out of memory and instead return a 500 internal service error message. This will render one of two ways: either as an ugly blank screen with a bunch of useless information on it, or an ugly blank screen with nothing on it. Neither makes your visitors think you&rsquo;re a very competent company (Best case scenario is that the server delivers a cached version of the page). The 80mb allocated by Dreamhost is generally more than enough for most PHP-based CMS systems (Drupal, WordPress, Joomla!); if not, you can scale to their Virtual Private Server plans relatively easily.</p>

<h2>Industry-leading tech support</h2>

<p>The world would be a beautiful place if only everyone was as helpful as Dreamhost&rsquo;s support staff is. I have dealt with an incredibly wide range of support personnel in my lifetime, and I will say without hesitation that Dreamhost&rsquo;s are the fastest, friendliest and most helpful I have ever encountered. When the shit hits the fan, these are the people that might be the difference between your site being down for five minutes or for five hours. This is not true for all webhosts — some I&rsquo;ve dealt with seem to have a total of one support staff, who&rsquo;s more accustomed to static HTML pages than these newfangled PHP script thingamawhatsit, and take not mere hours but whole <em>weeks</em> to respond. In addition, they have a lot excellent official and community-supported documentation, detailing everything from configuring your email client to installing a custom PHP.ini file.</p>

<h2>100% Uptime Guarantee</h2>

<p>If you notice your site&rsquo;s down due to problems on Dreamhost&rsquo;s behalf, <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/hosting-100-percent-uptime-guarantee.html">they&rsquo;ll give you a day of free hosting for each hour</a> (or fraction thereof) your account is inaccessible (upon opening the support ticket). Given Dreamhost is pretty inexpensive to begin with, this means a day of downtime (and lost work if your company uses web-based systems through its website) will save you roughly $7 in hosting. However, my experience has been that downtime is fairly rare with Dreamhost and is often fixed by the time I send the support ticket (On that note, if anybody knows of some comparative data analyzing downtime between large webhosts, I&rsquo;d be very interested).</p>

<h2>Great newsletters</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m really adverse to promotional materials; my inbox is cluttered with an astounding array of things I&rsquo;ve subscribed to but don&rsquo;t ever actually read. Dreamhost&rsquo;s monthly newsletters do not fall into this category — they manage to be both informative and entertaining and I look forward to each. Beyond these sporadic and often-late mailouts, Dreamhost uses very minimal email marketing.</p>

<p>I could go on, really. Post in the comments if you want a coupon code.</p>

Apologies if it&rsquo;s a bit barren right now; I&rsquo;m gradually porting all of my old content from Joomla! 1.5x to Drupal 7x (which I do far more development in now). Eventually this will link to everything I do. To get back to the old aendrew.com, go to <a href="http://v3.aendrew.com">v3.aendrew.com</a>.</p>
