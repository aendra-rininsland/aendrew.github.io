  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><h2>A bit about Demotix&hellip;</h2>

<ul>
<li>Background is politics and freelancing</li>
<li>Desire to create not just a socially-responsible business, but a &ldquo;actively good&rdquo; one</li>
<li>Basic idea was to create a safe platform for anyone wanting to upload stories not being covered.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Free speech as soft power&rdquo; &mdash; led to democratization of regions such as the Middle East.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Mainstream media has been shedding jobs like a 70 year old man sheds hair.&rdquo;

<ul>
<li>Both foreign correspondents and local reporters are being cut.</li>
<li>Only 4 US newspapers even have a foreign desk.</li>
<li>Even the BBC doesn&rsquo;t have a full-time staffer in Latin America.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This enshrines &ldquo;parachute journalism&rdquo;.

<ul>
<li>Shallow knowledge of local issue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ever-increasing reliance on AP and Reuters for world news.

<ul>
<li>Ramifications for free speech.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Business model: instead of big networks of volunteers, Demotix receives content, sells it to newspapers and splits the take 50/50.

<ul>
<li>Launched in 2009; got scoops because of local journalists.

<ul>
<li>In June of that year, had several journalists in Iran when Ahmadinejad declared himself president after only one round of voting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>London-based sales team, global network of resellers, strategic partnership with Corbis</li>
</ul>


<h2>&ldquo;What we realized we couldn&rsquo;t do&rdquo;</h2>

<ul>
<li>To build a model on citizen journalism, you have to get content that&rsquo;s sellable.

<ul>
<li>Text is really difficult

<ol>
<li>. Most papers will tell you people can&rsquo;t write</li>
<li>. Impossible to copyright data; can&rsquo;t sell it as text.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Despite starting as a platform for free speech, platform is mainly used for photo and video.</li>
<li>Good at: bomb fallout, protests, Arab Spring, etc.</li>
<li>Some contributors are able to live off earnings. Would be breaking even if weren&rsquo;t reinvesting at current pace.</li>
<li>People actually contributing journalistic content is a really small number.</li>
<li>&ldquo;80/20 rule is actually 99/1 when it comes to useful content.&rdquo; &mdash; Web 2.0 is a myth.</li>
<li>Very few people actually interested in newsgathering.</li>
<li>Built network by a lot of reaching out to groups like local camera clubs.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The way you go out and build your community in the beginning is how your community will be forever.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Example of Digg:

<ul>
<li>Used to be really cutting-edge stuff; lost their original users. Became free for all and lost its actual value.</li>
<li>Demotix, going for a specific demographic, has retained its user base.

<ul>
<li>One of its competitors (Citizen Site) sought to grow user base as much as possible and while they get the occasional good scoop, it&rsquo;s not as consistent.

<ul>
<li>That said, they&rsquo;re doing some interesting gamification stuff.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gamification: &ldquo;Web gurus treat human beings as children &mdash; and are right to do so.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Temptation to use internal stats to gamify content filtering process, but feeling is it cheapens the process of journalism.</li>
<li>Worries about faked content. Happens to everyone and would be brutally bad if done early on. Use metadata and calling to verify.</li>
<li>Balance between speed and quality.

<ul>
<li>Quality of photojournalism has vastly improved over the last decade or so, with everyone taking photos.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Storyful: &ldquo;opposite of Demotix&rdquo; in approach. Acts as breaking story news curation service.

<ul>
<li>Both pushes highly-shared stories to the front as well as verifies the content.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No way around using humans for news</li>
<li>Contributors everywhere except Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa</li>
<li>Important points for communities:

<ul>
<li>Improving that communities news</li>
<li>Learning how to engage that community is very important

<ul>
<li> Community is who will decide your front page. Off-site, will write your content.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Questions to audience:</h2>

<ul>
<li>How has the relationship between journalist and audience changed?

<ul>
<li>Pew: &ldquo;Views of the News Media 1985-2011&rdquo;</li>
<li>Content quality has decreased</li>
<li>Culture of deference has lessened</li>
<li>Simultaneously adds new voices but decrease of trust in accuracy makes everything relative; what is true?</li>
<li>Liveblogging as a direct result of citizen journalism: &ldquo;article without the stitching&rdquo; due to the realization readers can &ldquo;do the stitching themselves.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Downside is we have nobody to trust.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How does a community impact the way in which you create news?

<ul>
<li>To drive engagement, repeat visits, etc.</li>
<li>Newspapers start from a negative position &mdash; inaccurate, partisan and influenced. The community is those readers who have overcome that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is UGC good/bad at?

<ul>
<li>Good at: news sourcing, accuracy, trust, speed, data crunching, content</li>
<li>Bad at: access, investigative work, writing = &ldquo;lowest common denominator journalism&rdquo;

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;You cannot do citizen journalism without a professional journalism lead.&rdquo;

<ul>
<li>The job of professional journalists now is to learn to manage these networks as effectively as possible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Seymour Hersh at the New Yorker cannot be replaced by UGC &mdash; he has relationships, time/funding, exceptionally difficult work, verification. Writes 10,000 word articles that are read.</li>
<li>Hackgate is another example of something that couldn&rsquo;t be discovered by UGC.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What are the implications for journalism? Can UGC address some of the bigger blindspots in journalism? What is the next phase?

<ul>
<li>Shift in trust from professionalism to authenticity.

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;From Encyclopaedia Britannica to Wikipedia.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Things better managed as communities will become communities (i.e., Craigslist). Things that need unique curation and authority will continue to be run by journalists.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How do you sell truth?

<ul>
<li>Stories are now &ldquo;collections of subjectivities.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><h3>Internships</h3>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;The more clear you are about what you&rsquo;re wanting to get out of an internship, the more likely it is you&rsquo;ll get something useful.&rdquo;

<ul>
<li>Portfolio pieces

<ul>
<li>Go for it, but don&rsquo;t be disappointed if not.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Contacts</li>
<li>Career navigation</li>
<li>Publication map</li>
<li>Skill tips</li>
<li>Specialist knowledge

<ul>
<li> Unlikely in 1-2 weeks</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Each publication has a specific structure, and the more you can understand that, the better off you&rsquo;ll be and the more you&rsquo;ll learn

<ul>
<li>What is the power structure? Who decides things?

<ul>
<li>Who decides &ldquo;when the talking stops&rdquo; and what happens?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This can be difficult in newsrooms &mdash; informal and formal power structures.

<ul>
<li>Formally the foreign editor should decide the coverage but in practice the editor might decide.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&ldquo;Unleash your inner anthropologist.&rdquo;

<ul>
<li>Most newspapers can be divided into two categories, with sources of power in both:

<ol>
<li> Input

<ul>
<li>How are resources allocated; what do readers want; who&rsquo;s going to do what?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Output

<ul>
<li>Once that raw material has come in, what&rsquo;s important, what priority it&rsquo;s going to get, where it&rsquo;ll go, how it&rsquo;ll be changed, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In a well-resourced and well-conducted media organization, not a single word would make it on page without going through the hands of at least 3 people.

<ul>
<li>Filter 1: section editor. Often no more than a glance.</li>
<li>Filter 2: night editor. Also a quick look: what a story is, what its projection possibilities are, etc.</li>
<li>Filter 3: sub editor. Trim to spec, put on page, etc.</li>
<li>Filter 4: revision editor. Review and make necessary changes</li>
<li>And on&hellip;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Learning who these people are and talking with them will improve your writing</li>
<li>Figure out the input side &mdash; where are ideas decided, are there idea generation meetings, etc.?

<ul>
<li>Make sure you have ideas ready for forward planning meetings.

<ul>
<li> Study the power structures before piping up — will your input be helpful/welcomed?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Find out where there&rsquo;s a need — usually a surplus of people wanting to write and a deficit of people wanting to make others look good (i.e., editing)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Find sympathetic people who will let you shadow them

<ul>
<li>Is there a good editor who will let you look over their shoulder while doing a massive cutting job? Sometimes simply studying somebody who excels at their job is more instructive than trying to get pieces into the paper.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Go to conferences if possible</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t disdain desks in out of the way places.

<ul>
<li>If you want to improve your writing, you&rsquo;ll get more practice and watch more editors if you go to a less prominent, less glamourous desk &mdash; i.e., obituaries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Obvious but important: read the output of the place you&rsquo;re working at, and especially before you even get there</li>
</ul>


<h3>CVs</h3>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t do more than 2 pages.

<ul>
<li>If you can&rsquo;t get your life in your early 20s in under 2 pages, you&rsquo;re not going to convince someone you&rsquo;re good at distilling information</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Watch for spelling and grammar errors. Even the smallest errors will get your resume binned.

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;It is never possible for a single individual to check their own work perfectly &mdash; give it to somebody else.&rdquo;

<ul>
<li> &ldquo;Carelessness has extremely high cost&rdquo; &mdash; your application is the first contact your organization will have with your writing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Cover letters</h3>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s a courtesy; keep it brief</li>
<li>Briefly say what sets you apart</li>
<li>Mention why you want to work at that specific paper; establish your connection to that place.</li>
</ul>


<h3>What employers look for:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Intellectual originality</li>
<li>Passion</li>
<li>Good degrees</li>
<li>Determination</li>
<li>Make the most of what&rsquo;s interesting about you</li>
<li>If you miss a graduate internship by a close distance, remember that most people who made it to the interview round still became successful journalists.</li>
<li>Finally — remember these are organizations aiming for large audiences; don&rsquo;t overplay blogging.

<ul>
<li>Show you can write stories for several hundred thousand people, not nine people. Don&rsquo;t confuse writing for small, friendly audiences with spotting a story interesting to massive audiences.</li>
</ul>
</li>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><h3>UPDATE: there&rsquo;s no Greenslade lecture today (Nov. 14); today&rsquo;s meeting is thus moved to 3:00 p.m.</h3>

<p>First off, sorry to anyone frustrated with the scheduling of these meetings — most of the people interested so far are in the Newspaper/Interactive program, making it difficult to accommodate the Broadcast and Investigative folks interested in attending. Such was the case yesterday; I had anticipated our interviewing class would be over no later than 4:00 p.m. (giving us an hour to return from Westminster to the university), but in reality it lasted until 4:30 p.m., giving us no hope in returning in time to make the meeting. I made an executive decision to move the meeting to a nearby pub so at least a few of us could discuss things and attempted to inform anyone else who had previously expressed interest that this was the case; apologies to anyone who showed up at Saddlers.</p>

<p>Two notes on that point:</p>

<h2>1. Meetings are now <em>every</em> <em>Monday</em> @ <em>5 pm</em></h2>

<p>Eventually these will change to be biweekly or even monthly, with the intent of creating smaller breakout groups to focus on specific tasks or ideas with more frequent meeting times. This will be impossible until we reach a certain critical mass, so we&rsquo;re going to try meeting more frequently this semester and with a focus on discussion and logistics. With any luck, we can start moving towards a project-based focus by next semester.</p>

<p>Additionally, it has been suggested we move to <strong>Monday</strong> evening in fairness to the non-Newspaper/Interactive folk. This makes a lot of sense — all of us are in Greenslade&rsquo;s lecture and will thus be in the same area at the same time.</p>

<h2>2. News, discussion and updates will be posted in the <strong>#cityjtech</strong> hashtag; announcements posted from <strong><a href="http://www.twitter.com/cityjtech">@cityjtech</a></strong></h2>

<p>It would&rsquo;ve been a lot easier to inform people the venue had changed had I created a hashtag earlier on. I&rsquo;m proposing #cityjtech (and have registered <a href="http://www.twitter.com/cityjtech">@cityjtech</a>) for this purpose. We could use #cjtech if people are finding that too long, but I figure consistency and descriptiveness are more important at this point. Please comment if you disagree.</p>

<h3>Addressing some misconceptions</h3>

<p>To address a few questions I&rsquo;ve been receiving:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Do I need to know a lot about programming?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Not at all! Some of the projects we&rsquo;ll eventually work towards will involve some heavy development work, but this is where City&rsquo;s epic alumni network will come in. Your experience and aptitude as a journalist is what will make this group special. For non-journalists, your outside experience will greatly aid our discussion. If you do program, your technical expertise will be helpful in moving ideas forward. <strong>Everyone is welcome, regardless of technical knowledge.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Is this a big time commitment?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t need to be. This group is designed to allow a broad spectrum of participation — everything from contributing ideas and discussion to hacking code. MA programmes are really labour-intensive; commit at a level you&rsquo;re comfortable with.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Is this just a bunch of stuff about WordPress?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>It won&rsquo;t be. Some focus on WordPress is natural given how widely used it is in our programme and the ease with which it can be extended. However, while WordPress is great for some purposes, it really isn&rsquo;t the future of online journalism — it&rsquo;s a blogging platform. If you find WordPress terribly uninteresting, please say so! There&rsquo;s lots of room for technology of all sorts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<h3>Finally, we have some champions!</h3>

<p>In project management terms, a champion is somebody who will invest time and energy to see that an initiative succeeds. For City J-Tech, I&rsquo;m asking champions regularly show up for meetings and tweet about CULJTEG events. These people can essentially be considered group co-founders. As of last meeting, this list includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>John Burn-Murdoch (<a href="http://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch">@jburnmurdoch</a>)</li>
<li>Teodora Beleaga (<a href="http://twitter.com/t30d0ra">@t30d0ra</a>)</li>
</ul>


<p>If interested in being a regular part of the group and helping promote it, drop me a line or leave a comment!</p>

<h2>Next meeting is Monday, November 14 at Saddlers Bar!</h2>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><ul>
<li>Community management becoming more and more important

<ul>
<li>Makes sites:

<ul>
<li>sticky and engaged</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Makes information collection:

<ul>
<li>distributed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Community content becomes:

<ul>
<li>editorially valuable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Things that impacted helpmeinvestigate:

<ul>
<li>The 1% of content creators have a very real effect on crowdsourcing</li>
<li>Modularity is important &mdash; being able to break down tasks</li>
<li>Two types of crowdsourcing:

<ul>
<li>MechanicalTurk version

<ul>
<li>Guardian MPs expenses crowdsourcing project

<ul>
<li>Not a lot of diversity in a population, just a lot of people</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Investigative version

<ul>
<li>Ability to get specialists to work on projects</li>
<li>Visibility is key</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mistakes:

<ul>
<li>Don’t mistake Twitter/forums for a broadcast medium</li>
<li>“Field of dreams” approach

<ul>
<li>“Build it and they will come” doesn’t particularly work.

<ul>
<li>Don’t start with the technology; start with the people and the networks
⁃ The “Post” process
⁃ People
⁃ Objectives
⁃ “Get a good story” isn’t an objective the community will care about
⁃ Strategy
⁃ Often you won’t be managing a community, but are rather just a member needing to establish your own clout.
⁃ Technology
⁃ “Otherwise you’re walking around with a hammer and everything looks like a nail.”
⁃ Remember copyright
⁃ The “second visit problem”
⁃ How do you get people to return?
⁃ Problem of expansion and scalability
⁃ Give people explicit tasks and project inputs
⁃ Allow creation of groups
⁃ “The Wikipedia Revolution”
⁃ How Wikipedia dealt with the scaling problem
⁃ Easy-to-use tools
⁃ Don’t assume one tool will be the easiest for everyone.
⁃ ToS, culture of site
⁃ Newspapers experience difficulty because they start with big groups of people and can’t create a specific user culture
⁃ Shirky &mdash; communities need tools to defend themselves.
⁃ Reward those who are helpful, hinder those who aren’t.
⁃ Karma systems, etc.</li>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><h5>Answers from last week:</h5>

<ol>
<li>Jigsaw identification &mdash; individual identifiable even though name not explicitly given, i.e., through multiple pieces of info</li>
<li>Court sketches have to be done outside the court from memory</li>
<li>CPS media protocol is a protocol agreed between media organizations and crown prosecution service detailing how material (i.e., CCTV footage) used in court can be used in the media.

<ul>
<li>If shown to the jury in open court, material then given to the media.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>§ 8, Contempt of Court Act 1981 &mdash; offense to speak to or solicit info from a juror regarding jury deliberations.</li>
<li>12 jurors in criminal trial; 11-1 or 10-2 for majority verdict after period of at least 2 hours, unanimous decision preferred.</li>
</ol>


<h5>Questions for next week:</h5>

<ol>
<li>What is Sec. 39 of Children and Young Persons Act?</li>
<li>What is PACE, and what does it say about disclosure of journalist material to police?</li>
<li>What is the meaning of the word &ldquo;redaction&rdquo;?</li>
<li>In the broadcast media, what is the watershed?</li>
<li>What is a Newton hearing?</li>
</ol>


<h4>Where in class?</h4>

<p>Modules 1-3 are finished. First 14 chapters of textbook, plus human rights act, contempt of court act, PCC code of practice, Ofcom Broadcast code</p>

<h3>What type of information can lead to contempt proceedings?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Photographs of defendant when ID is an issue (Child abduction cases; identification parades; etc.)

<ul>
<li>Police press office will often make it known when identification is an issue.</li>
<li>Barrister will argue witness was predisposed by what was published; can dramatically mess up a case.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Previous convictions</li>
<li>Bad character

<ul>
<li>Attorney General v. Associated Newspapers LTD and News Group Newspapers Ltd (2011)

<ul>
<li>Even though only online, still contempt the court &mdash; even despite jury being told not to go online and search for details.

<ul>
<li>Jury being told not to look for details applies specifically to jury going sleuthing, not all online news browsing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Vilification of the defendant

<ul>
<li>Jeffries case re: Joanna Yates &mdash; painted negative picture; resulted in libel damages <em>and</em> contempt prosecutions for Mirror Group and Sun. Would have discouraged witness to support Jeffries.</li>
<li>Between the bad character and Jeffries case, &ldquo;Contempt is now alive and kicking as a course of law&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Detailed account of the evidence against the defendant

<ul>
<li>Talking about undisputed facts is okay, however, not giving detailed examinations of evidence against defendant</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Details of confessions

<ul>
<li>At trial, the confession itself may be open to debate. Could prejudice jury if a newspaper details facts of confession in the meantime.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Comment on the evidence

<ul>
<li>Only what&rsquo;s said in court without giving judgement</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Predictions on the verdict</li>
<li>Reconstructions

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Crimewatch&rdquo; et al do reconstructions before arrests have been made, is okay.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>To avoid:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Comment on the evidence/credibility of witnesses</li>
<li>Adding extrinsic material/information/images that are not part of the evidence</li>
<li>Broad reconstructions of contested evidence</li>
<li>Predictions on witnesses/the outcome of the trial</li>
<li>Legal argument in absence of jury

<ul>
<li> Disclosable at end of trial but not while jury is in situ.</li>
<li> &ldquo;Voir dire&rdquo; legal argument during course of the trial.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Guilty pleas not known to the jury

<ul>
<li>Defendants might plea guilty in order to get lower sentence</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Site visits showing jurors or identifying jurors.

<ul>
<li>Jury visited murder site in Joanna Yates case; identifying jurors through these is contempt</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>What you <em>should</em> do:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Use stock phrases to make clear these are only allegations and not proven fact</li>
<li>Use quotes where possible</li>
</ul>


<h3>Incidental risk</h3>

<ul>
<li>§5 Contempt of Court Act 1981

<ul>
<li>Discussion of matters of public interest in good faith where risk is incidental</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Attorney General v. English (1983)

<ul>
<li>Daily Mail discussed pro-life candidate during case of doctor who had killed a Downs Syndrome child.

<ul>
<li>Just because a trial is taking place in relation to a certain subject doesn&rsquo;t mean discussion of that subject is completely shut down.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Preliminary hearings</h3>

<ul>
<li>Magistrates Court §8 Magistrates Courts Act 1980 &mdash; What <em>can</em> be reported

<ul>
<li>Name of court, magistrates, lawyers</li>
<li>Names/address defendant, witnesses</li>
<li>Decision whether to commit for trial</li>
<li>Whether Legal Aid granted</li>
<li>Whether reporting restrictions lifted</li>
<li>Arrangements as to bail, including conditions such as a condition of residence at a certain address but <strong>not</strong> reasons for refusal for bail — such as the defendant&rsquo;s previous convictions or likelihood of re-offending</li>
<li>Preliminary hearings in the Crown Court.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Victims of sexual offences</h3>

<ul>
<li>Most victims gain automatic anonymity (absolute unless waived)</li>
<li>Sexual Offences Amendment Act 1976 and 1992</li>
<li>Must remain anonymous

<ul>
<li>What is anonymous?

<ul>
<li>Would they be recognized by own mother? If so, then not anonymous.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jigsaw identification

<ul>
<li>Must be prevented; identification cannot be from random bits of info</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pixellation/voice distortion/background</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can be personal prosecuted</li>
<li>Waiving anonymity must be in writing</li>
<li>Takes place even after proceedings, <strong>ad infinitum</strong>, <em>and even post mortem.</em></li>
</ul>


<h3>Filming at court</h3>

<ul>
<li>Must be outside precincts of court</li>
<li>Cannot broadcast proceedings

<ul>
<li>Criminal Justice Act 1925</li>
<li>The Supreme Court</li>
<li>Plans by the Ministry of Justice to potentially allow filming in Appeals Court and Supreme Court (?) &mdash; not finalized</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sketches

<ul>
<li>Cannot sketch in court</li>
<li>Must be from memory, outside of court</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tape recordings §9 Contempt of Court Act 1981</li>
<li>Tweeting in court: allowed if judge lets it (go through Clerk of the Court); normal contempt of court rules apply.</li>
</ul>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Just a quick City University London Journalism Technology Exploration Group (CULJTEG) update — last week was supposed to be our first meeting, however, we’ve postponed it until tomorrow, Tues. November 8, at 5:00 p.m. given everyone was super drained following the six-hour public administration fun-for-all that day.</p>

<p>So, to reiterate: very first City J-Tech meeting Tues., Nov. 8 at 5:00 p.m., Saddlers Bar on campus. All are welcome to attend regardless of technical ability, concentration or programme— the only prerequisite is a desire to improve reporting through technology.</p>

<p>Tentative schedule:</p>

<ol>
<li>Initial decisions:

<ul>
<li>What should we call the group</li>
<li>What will we focus on?</li>
<li>Is Saddlers a good venue?</li>
<li>Who will champion this idea?

<ul>
<li>I.e., who is willing to commit to promotion and being at every meeting?)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Open discussion</li>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><ul>
<li>Long-term trend towards rise of government and public sector research

<ul>
<li>Increased emphasis on evidence-based policymaking

<ul>
<li>consultation</li>
<li>policy options</li>
<li>evaluating results</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Greater demand for user-focused services

<ul>
<li>scoping needs</li>

<li>Public service reform/more for less</li>
<li>Co-production and behaviour change</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rising demands for accountability and transparency</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Works across all areas of public policy</li>
<li>Only 0.16% of work is political polling for the media.</li>
<li>Public opinion poll: views of a representative sample of a defined population.</li>
<li>Polling measures perceptions rather than truth.

<ul>
<li>Perceptions determine public opinion — <strong>not truth</strong>.</li>
<li>Perceptions are also outcomes in their own right.

<ul>
<li>Our experiences of services determine perceptions of their quality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fear often has little relationship to risk

<ul>
<li>Fear of crime has gone up, but crime has ultimately gone down.</li>
<li>Worries about litter and environmental factors always rate highly; when addressed, overall worries about crime decrease.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Polls important, but need to be used appropriately.

<ul>
<li>How they&rsquo;re reported is also very important.</li>
<li>Only 2/3 of people can easily reduce 20% to 1/5 (I.e., percent to a fraction)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Four main poll types:

<ul>
<li>Peacetime polls (where we are now)

<ul>
<li>Snapshot indicator of how the public thinks it should vote at a given moment.</li>
<li>Polls don&rsquo;t predict what would happen; ask about a hypothetical election, answers are hypothetical too.

<ul>
<li>Better seen as a barometer &mdash; doesn&rsquo;t predict the weather, measure something that is useful to know in predicting the weather.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Regular Ipsos MORI opinion polls

<ul>
<li>Monthly political monitor</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ICM, Yougov, GfK NOP, Populus, Comres, et al.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Campaign polls (during the campaign itself)

<ul>
<li>Measures what the public thinks it is going to do, but not a perfect predictor.

<ul>
<li>14% of voters in 2010 said they made up their minds on whether/how they&rsquo;ll vote in the final 24 hours, another 9% in the last week.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Interesting angle &mdash; key marginal seats. Collaborated with Reuters.</li>
<li>The Ipsos MORI &ldquo;Worm&rdquo; &mdash; how opinion changes during leaders&#8217; speeches.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Final poll (eve of election poll &mdash; includes adjustments not applied to other polls; not &ldquo;pure&rdquo; polling

<ul>
<li>Exclude not registered to vote (5%)</li>
<li>Check postal voting (15%)</li>
<li>Further turnout adjustments:

<ul>
<li>Definitely decided or might change mind</li>
<li>How important is the result</li>
<li>How certain if raining</li>
<li>Whether sample has been contacted by campaigners</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Plus: call-backs for late swing and imputed vote of refusers.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Armchair&rdquo; Labour voters &mdash; say they&rsquo;ll vote Labour but don&rsquo;t turn out.</li>
<li>Was pretty close last election to outcome.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Exit poll (Who you voted for instead of how you&rsquo;ll vote)

<ul>
<li>Sit outside election booths and ask people.</li>
<li>Careful selection of polling stations</li>
<li>One person watches people leaving with a counter, send the other to select someone every n (10?) people.</li>
<li>Selected people are given a ballot, are asked to mark it. Results taken back and interpreted.</li>
<li>Tends to be polling stations since last time; look at &ldquo;swing,&rdquo; or amount of change. Attempt to extrapolate to entire constituency and see whether enough swing to unseat incumbent.</li>
<li>Add up the sum of all swing to see how much change in system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What makes a good poll?

<ul>
<li>Question wording is crucial.

<ul>
<li>Be relevant to respondent</li>
<li>Be easily understood</li>
<li>Unambiguous in meaning</li>
<li>Mean the same to client, researcher and all respondents</li>
<li>Relate to the survey objectives</li>
<li>Not be overly influenced by the context of the question</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Having a good sample is crucial

<ul>
<li>Purely &lsquo;random&rsquo; sampling no longer used — too difficult, expensive.</li>
<li>Well-conducted quota sampling produces weighted samples with a variance similar to random samples of the same size</li>
<li>Most people don&rsquo;t have strong views on a lot of things; you want their voice represented as well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reading and reporting the polls

<ul>
<li>However static public opinion actually is, the polls provide the media with a basis for giving the impression of flux, change and excitements. The more polls there are &hellip; the more true this is.</li>
<li>However improbable a poll finding is, the media will publish of broadcast it. The more improbable a poll&rsquo;s finding is, the more likely the media will give it prominence.</li>
<li>Good questions to ask:

<ul>
<li>When were the fieldwork dates?</li>
<li>Was the sample representative</li>
<li>Is it a panel study, face-to-face, telephone or an online poll?</li>
<li>Are the questions unbiased?</li>
<li>Are differences statistically significant?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Watch the share, not the lead.

<ul>
<li>Shares should be within margin of error; it is this that will lead to variances in lead.</li>
<li>Differences will not be statistically significant.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Things to watch:

<ul>
<li>Generalising beyond the sample</li>
<li>Implying change when no trend has been measured</li>
<li>Emphasising the unimportant</li>
<li>Highlighting statistically insignificant findings</li>
<li>Quoting out of context</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Curious and spurious: the Sweet FA Prediction Model

<ul>
<li>Weird correlation between the colours of the FA winner and the government taking power that year.

<ul>
<li>Data can be found that fits whatever prediction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Polling isn&rsquo;t designed to predict the future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</ul>


<p>Media issue of the week: Lord Chief Justice laying out thoughts on the role of the media (full @ judiciary.gov.uk)
+ Principle of freedom of press not explicitly stated, but enshrined in various documents.</p>

<pre><code>+ Free press is important; independent press can be reckless, but important for revealing public scandal.
+ "Crime is crime"; if a reporter commits a crime, it should be investigated.
+ Press Complaints Commission 20 years old; failure to exercise its powers indicative of an understanding of its position.
    + Comparable to a judge not passing the lengthiest sentence possible in a case.
</code></pre>

<p>Reading to date: terminology of first module, all the appendices, missed other stuff, need to ask somebody.</p>

<h2>Contempt of Court Act 1981</h2>

<ul>
<li>Purpose:

<ul>
<li>Avoid trial by media</li>
<li>Defendant&rsquo;s right to be tried on the evidence</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Restricts reporting whilst sub judice

<ul>
<li>While proceedings are on, there are restrictions on what can be reported.</li>
<li>Protects jurors, defendant.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Open Justice

<ul>
<li>Justice should be seen to be done, as well as done.</li>
<li>Subject to scrutiny.</li>
<li>Doors of court are open to public.</li>
<li>Allows transparency.</li>
<li>Also part of the European Convention on Human Rights &mdash; right to an public trial, though with qualifications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can information be controlled?</li>
<li>Article 6 and 10 European Convention on Human Rights

<h3>The central contempt test</h3></li>
<li>Proceedings active from arrest/issue of warrant for an arrest.</li>
<li>The test:

<ul>
<li>A publication which creates a substantial risk that the course of justice in the proceedings in question will be seriously impeded or prejudiced.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Strict liability &mdash; intent has little to do with it.</li>
<li>Enforced by the attorney general.

<ul>
<li>Has to consent to a prosecution against a periodical.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Applies to a <strong>risk</strong> of prejudice, not actual prejudice.

<ul>
<li>Attorney General v. Express News

<ul>
<li>Daily Star published photos and names of footballers arrested in rape case despite Attorney General&rsquo;s request

<ul>
<li> No trial ever carried out, but Daily Star fined £60,000 for <em>risk</em> of prejudice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Attorney General v. MGN Ltd. and News Group Newspapers LTD (2011)

<ul>
<li>Joana Yates case &mdash; number of publications in Sun and Mirror that focused on Christopher Jeffries, Yates landlord.

<ul>
<li> Said landlord was peeping tom, has pedophile friend in jail, was obsessed by death, suggested had followed a woman contrary to wishes (immense vilification)</li>
<li> Both found in contempt of court; £18k and £50k fines. Could have prevented people from speaking up, jurors coming to court with an open mind.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Sanctions:</h3>

<pre><code>+ Fines
+ Legal costs
+ Imprisonment
+ Wasted costs order: S93 Courts Act 2003
    + Third Party costs orders
    + "serious misconduct"
    + No need for contempt to be charged; attorney general does not have to give consent, judges can do it themselves.
</code></pre>

<h3>Prior to arrest</h3>

<ul>
<li>Common law contempt

<ul>
<li>Information serious prejudiced proceedings</li>
<li>Intention</li>
<li>Imminent</li>
<li>Rarely prosecuted</li>
<li>AG v. News Group Newspapers (1989)

<ul>
<li>Printed reports of doctor having raped 18 year old; Sun printed interviews with relatives stating they&rsquo;d start a private prosecution.

<ul>
<li>Proceedings were imminent; real risk and intention of behalf of publication to muck up proceedings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Libel &mdash; even if contempt proceedings not brought.

<ul>
<li>Sexual offense victims have lifelong right to anonymity. Can be waived, but must be in writing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>When are proceedings active?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Active from:

<ul>
<li>Arrest</li>
<li>Issue of warrant for arrest</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ends:

<ul>
<li>By acquittal or sentence</li>
<li>Discontinuance of proceedings</li>
<li>Staggered verdicts (i.e., multiple charges, defendants)

<ul>
<li> Proceedings are still active and continue until all verdicts reached</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Contempt: factors that may be relevant</h3>

<ul>
<li>The decision maker: jury or judge

<ul>
<li>After jury has made decision, the judge becomes the decision maker. Latter is less likely to be influenced by TV/media.</li>
<li>Laws under statute are primarily geared towards defending jury.</li>
<li>&ldquo;red alert&rdquo; any time there&rsquo;s a jury.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The impact on potential juror?</li>
<li>Each report looked at separately</li>
<li>What stage of proceedings?

<ul>
<li>The &ldquo;Fade Factor&rdquo;

<ul>
<li>Chance of contempt is much more likely when jury is in-situ as opposed to initial arrest.</li>
<li>Further away from trial, less likelihood for contempt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Examples of material may be in contempt</h3>

<ul>
<li>Photographs of defendant when ID is an issue</li>
<li>Previous convictions</li>
<li>Bad character

<ul>
<li>Attorney General v. Associated Newspapers LTD and News Group Newspapers Ltd. (2011)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Vilification of the defendant</li>
<li>Details account of the evidence against the defendant</li>
<li>Details of confessions</li>
</ul>
