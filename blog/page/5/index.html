  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>For next class &mdash; Ch. 20</p>

<h2>Libel, cont’d</h2>

<p>Quiz of the week:
+ What is the Reynolds Defence? What are the ten factors?
+ What is the offer of amends defence? An example of when it can be used?
+ What is the defence of innocent dissemination?
+ What is the difference between general damages and special damages?
+ What is the rule in Bonnard v. Perryman</p>

<p>Defamation defences</p>

<p>Justification
+ Burden of proof is on the broadcaster/publisher
+ How are you going to prove the truth?
+ What is the evidence you can rely on?
+ Assessing the evidence</p>

<p>Fair Comment
+ An opinion
+ Based on true facts
+ Made honestly</p>

<pre><code>+ “True test is whether the opinion is being made honestly by the person giving it.”
    + Bonnard v. Perryman
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Has to be made without malice

<ul>
<li>Can also be considered as being published with recklessness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Not very successful as a defence standing alone.

<ul>
<li>Berkoff v. Burchill (1996)

<ul>
<li>Latter wrote a review in Sunday Times. Said “From Hitchcock to Berkoff, directors are notoriously hideous-looking people.” Compared Berkoff to Frankenstein monster.</li>
<li>Times made application to strike case out; argued fair comments.</li>
<li>Both high court and court of appeal dismissed Times application.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Associated Newspapers v. Burstein (2007)

<ul>
<li>Playwright tried to sue about a play re: suicide bombers after reviewer said the play had anti-American undertones.</li>
<li>Playwright failed, judges argued writers of creative work necessarily expose themselves to criticism.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dee V. Daily Telegraph (2008)

<ul>
<li>Player described as “World’s worst tennis player” after having lost a ton of matches.</li>
<li>Case was struck out; ruled that newspaper didn’t have to inconclusively prove he was the worst player in the world.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Spiller v. Joseph (2010)

<ul>
<li>Supreme Court said the defence should be referred to as “Honest Comment” instead of “Fair Comment”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Offer of Amends
+ Honest mistake
+ Defendant can claim a defence of Offer of Amends if they try to correct the mistake.
+ §2-4 defamation act of 1996.
+ Mistake must have been made without malice.
+ Essentially a guilty plea; usually involves a settlement.
+ Damages often reduced than if went to a full hearing.</p>

<pre><code>+ Nail v. News Group Newspaper (2004)
    + Nail was given lesser damages because News Group had made a rejected offer of amends.
</code></pre>

<p>Live Broadcasting
+ Innocent dissemination</p>

<pre><code>+ Defamation Act 1996.
    + Defence applies if the broadcaster can show it did not control the person making the statement, they took reasonable care in the circumstances, and did not think anything it did contributed to the publication of the statement.
    + Applies to interviewees; not staff journalists.
    + If somebody says something untrue (or even swears live), host can step in and apologize on the spot.
+ If service is a mere conduit with no editorial oversight, then they are not responsible.
    + Problems: disincentivizes patrolling commenting channels
        + Law doesn’t protect responsible broadcasters
</code></pre>

<p>Defence of Privilege
+ Defamation act 1996 &mdash; statutory privilege</p>

<pre><code>+ When reporting courts, parliaments or councils, it’s subject to privilege set down in councils.
    + However, the Reynolds Defence (i.e., public interest) is a commonlaw approach.
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Absolute Privilege

<ul>
<li>Contemporaneous fair and accurate court reports</li>
<li>If you’re being fair and accurate while reporting contemporaneously, you’re protected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Qualified Privilege

<ul>
<li>Malice/explanation</li>
<li>Fair and accurate court reports</li>
<li>Reports of a legislature here and abroad</li>
<li>Public meetings

<ul>
<li>McCarten Turkington Breen v. Times Newspapers (2001)

<ul>
<li>Times claimed privilege because statement made in a press conference (public meeting).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Commonlaw Qualified Privilege

<ul>
<li>Establishes a defence where newspapers are able to report things in the public interest.

<ul>
<li>Reynolds v. Times Newspapers (1998)

<ul>
<li>Albert Reynolds had made statement and had been accused by Times of misleading the Irish parliament. Went to the House of Lords, Times’ case was that it was in the public interest to report what happened in a parliament and should not fear legal proceedings by politicians. Times lost on the facts, but new precedent was set.</li>
<li>Judges set down 10 point test:

<pre><code>  1. Seriousness of allegation
  2. Source of information
  3. Steps taken by the journalists to verify information
  4. Tone of article -- making statements or requesting investigation?
  5. Urgency of the matter
  6. And on...
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Grobellaar v. The Sun (2001)

<ul>
<li>Investigation in the Sun making allegation that a goalkeeper had taken money to not make saves.</li>
<li>Court of appeals said qualified privilege would not apply in that case.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Galloway v. The Telegraph

<ul>
<li>Telegraph documents had suggested that Galloway had been in collusion with the Iraqi foreign embassy and had acted improperly. Galloway was named in documents.</li>
<li>Report wasn’t objective enough; wasn’t level-headed enough in its reporting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Exception: GKR Karate v. Yorkshire Post (2000)

<ul>
<li>Newspaper argued GKR was selling dodgy karate lessons</li>
<li>Court ruled that it was in the public interest to bring report to public, even though it was found GKR was in the right.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jameel v. Wall St Journal (2007)

<ul>
<li>Resurrected Reynolds</li>
<li>WSJ level-headedly and evenly reported about a bank and its potential links with terrorists.</li>
<li>Journalism should be allowed to flourish and there should be protection for investigative journalism within the law.</li>
<li>Test less set in stone than pointers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Protects reports in the public interest, not celebrity gossip.</li>
<li>If reporting on a matter of public interest in a level-headed, responsible manner, you may have a defence even if you get it wrong.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Entrepreneurial Journalism — “Journalism in the age of disruption”</p>

<p>Disruption &mdash; interruption of normal work and practices.
 + If it displaces an existing business or practice.
+ The economic mechanisms that have sustained quality journalism are in the process of being disrupted.
+ Effected by: scandals, increased transparency via groups like Wikileaks, and, mainly, slow innovation.
+ Disruption a painful process but offers opportunities for new businesses and rebirth.
+ Historical context:</p>

<pre><code>+ In the 18th century Britain moved from an agrarian to a machine-based economy via the industrial revolution
+ Britain’s trade routes and technological industry positioned the country well.
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Movement away from the era of mass production</li>
<li>Historic Fatality

<ul>
<li>Agriculture &mdash; is obviously beneficial. Once it caught on, it caught on quickly.

<ul>
<li>Satisfied deep human desires for settlement and consistency</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Division of power

<ul>
<li>Gradual erosion of power for centralized sources.</li>
<li>Gutenberg printing press disrupted the Catholic church’s control over the Christian faith.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Division of power has accelerated with the web

<ul>
<li>Near universal access to information, which can be freely shared with others</li>
<li>Cuts of middlemen</li>
<li>Anyone an express themselves and find an audience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As a result:

<ul>
<li>Flattens hierarchical power structures</li>
<li>Capital and information flows are faster, more fluid and chaotic</li>
<li>Accelerating innovation</li>
<li>Impulse is to both create and consume.</li>
<li>Audience increasingly alienated by the mass market approach to media.</li>
<li>Moore’s law specifies the speed of processors double every 18 months, but also that the cost of technology decreases, space and bandwidth increase.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Disruptive models

<ul>
<li>Perrato Principle:

<ul>
<li>80% of your profit will come from 20% of your inventory</li>
<li>Amazon undermined due to Toyatan retailing

<ul>
<li>Make more from selling misfires than hits (The Long Tail)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Music industry &mdash; failed to innovate because of rival subscription-based services with incomplete inventories and format wars

<ul>
<li>Apple rejected subscription model with iTunes by charging 99c per song, required individual songs to be sold instead of just whole albums</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Google particularly disruptive

<ul>
<li>Google’s main service is search, which is made profitable by Adwords.

<ul>
<li>Made newspaper advertising seem incredibly expensive and unreliable</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>“Prisoner’s dilemma” &mdash; Google takes away advertising revenue and commodifies news, but to remove stories from its service is to lose traffic to rivals.</li>
<li>Value of information is near zero on Internet; key is to find value in other aspects of journalism

<ul>
<li>Fact verification, sourcing, fact aggregation, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Some innovators
+ Controlivest</p>

<pre><code>+ Portuguese company
    + Gave away piece of silverware with each issue; missing an issue would mean having an incomplete set. The silverware cost a fraction of an issue/distribution.

      <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/content/rss-feed-planning-applications-and-appeals-hackney/">RSS Feed of Planning Applications and Appeals in Hackney</a></h1>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p><strong>UPDATED:</strong> Now allows you to filter based on a comma-separated list of wards! More accurate application geolocation data based on eastings/northings! Wicked, yo! See below!</p>

<p>Ever wanted a way to learn about planning applications and appeals in the London borough of Hackney? The borough council&rsquo;s website has an ASP-driven search tool for both applications and appeals, but no way to get the latest ones in something as convenient as an RSS feed.</p>

<p>To this end I&rsquo;ve built two scrapers via <a href="http://www.scraperwiki.com">ScraperWiki</a> (<a href="https://scraperwiki.com/scrapers/hackney_planning_simpletest_browser_attempt_1/">Applications</a> and <a href="https://scraperwiki.com/scrapers/hackney_planning_appeal_simpletest_browser/">Appeals</a>), which are feeding a <a href="https://scraperwiki.com/views/hackney_council_planning_and_appeals_rss_output/">view</a> outputting <a href="http://www.georss.org">GeoRSS</a>. To add it to Google Reader or another RSS-based tool:</p>

<ul>
<li>For a combined listing of both applications and appeals, regardless of geolocation success, use:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://views.scraperwiki.com/run/hackney_council_planning_and_appeals_rss_output/?">https://views.scraperwiki.com/run/hackney_council_planning_and_appeals_rss_output/?</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For just applications, use:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://views.scraperwiki.com/run/hackney_council_planning_and_appeals_rss_output/?feed=applications">https://views.scraperwiki.com/run/hackney_council_planning_and_appeals_rss_output/?feed=applications</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For just appeals, use:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://views.scraperwiki.com/run/hackney_council_planning_and_appeals_rss_output/?feed=appeals">https://views.scraperwiki.com/run/hackney_council_planning_and_appeals_rss_output/?feed=appeals</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>New!</strong> To return only records in specific wards, use ward=[comma-separated list of wards]

<ul>
<li>Example: <a href="https://views.scraperwiki.com/run/hackney_council_planning_and_appeals_rss_output/?wards=De%20Beauvoir,Olympic%20Development%20Authority">https://views.scraperwiki.com/run/hackney_council_planning_and_appeals_rss_output/?wards=De%20Beauvoir,Olympic%20Development%20Authority</a>

<ul>
<li>This returns all records that are either in De Beauvoir or through the Olympic Development Authority (Replace spaces with %20!)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To output only records with latitude/longitude data, add &amp;strict=true to the end. See note below.

<ul>
<li>Combined: <a href="https://views.scraperwiki.com/run/hackney_council_planning_and_appeals_rss_output/?strict=true">https://views.scraperwiki.com/run/hackney_council_planning_and_appeals_rss_output/?strict=true</a></li>
<li>Just applications: <a href="https://views.scraperwiki.com/run/hackney_council_planning_and_appeals_rss_output/?feed=applications&amp;strict=true">https://views.scraperwiki.com/run/hackney_council_planning_and_appeals_rss_output/?feed=applications&amp;strict=true</a></li>
<li>Just appeals: <a href="https://views.scraperwiki.com/run/hackney_council_planning_and_appeals_rss_output/?feed=appeals&amp;strict=true">https://views.scraperwiki.com/run/hackney_council_planning_and_appeals_rss_output/?feed=appeals&amp;strict=true</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p><strike>Note: I geolocate using ScraperWiki&rsquo;s built-in functions, which are dependent upon postal code. I may try to update the scrapers in the future to grab Eastings and Northings as applications related to sites without a postal code (for instance, those involving forthcoming Olympic sites) won&rsquo;t geocode and thus be omitted using the &ldquo;strict=true&rdquo; flag.</strike> I&rsquo;ve updated the script to grab eastings/northings for applications so they&rsquo;re way more accurate. Note that eastings/northings data is not available for appeals, which still use postal code geolocation and may thus be less accurate (Or lacking geolocation data in the unlikely event it&rsquo;s an appeal without a postal code.).</p>

<p>To see how this could be used in a more interesting way than just Google Reader, check out this <a href="http://www.rssmapper.com/map/map?id=201112111844033">RSSMapper Google Maps/geoRSS mashup</a> I made.</p>

<p><strong>Special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/rossjones">Ross Jones</a> who spent over an hour helping me figure out why my regex wouldn&rsquo;t work with the Hackney Council planning application search output.</strong></p>

<hr />

<p><em>British Waterways (BW) has been accused of “forcing out” Hackney’s boaters after it announced plans to limit mooring times and impose fines for overstaying in an area close to the Olympic site.</em></p>

<p><em>The organisation, which looks after waterways including the Regent’s Canal and River Lea, wants those who live on narrowboats to buy visitor passes, some costing in excess of hundreds of pounds per week, to moor in a specially designated zone close to the site.</em></p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>As part of a project I&rsquo;m working on for the <a href="http://hackneycitizen.co.uk">Hackney Citizen</a>, I&rsquo;m creating a comprehensive map of a lot of different stuff going on in Hackney. One thing that would be particularly useful would be ward boundaries, ultimately comprising the area of the whole borough.</p>

<p>Much to my surprise, I could not find a single omnibus Hackney ward shapefile anywhere online. Thus I&rsquo;ve created one, attached to this blog post.</p>

<iframe width="425" height="350" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=http:%2F%2Fwww.aendrew.com%2Ffiles%2Fhackney_wards.kmz&amp;aq=&amp;sll=51.56319,-0.048871&amp;sspn=0.008524,0.02193&amp;vpsrc=0&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=m&amp;ll=51.548799,-0.060519&amp;spn=0.05797,0.087984&amp;output=embed"></iframe>


<br /><small><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=embed&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=http:%2F%2Fwww.aendrew.com%2Ffiles%2Fhackney_wards.kmz&amp;aq=&amp;sll=51.56319,-0.048871&amp;sspn=0.008524,0.02193&amp;vpsrc=0&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=m&amp;ll=51.548799,-0.060519&amp;spn=0.05797,0.087984" style="color:#0000FF;text-align:left">View Larger Map</a></small>


<p><strike>Google Maps tops out at ~12 regions per page, so to get the entire borough you need to <a href="http://aendrew.com/sites/default/files/hackney_wards.kmz">download the full KMZ file</a> and load it into Google Earth. Going to the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=215653240665910605934.0004b39e926a519eded0c&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=51.546122,-0.060768&amp;spn=0.068215,0.175438&amp;iwloc=0004b39e94944f1f3f759">full map</a> gives you pagination, though the effect is still kind of lost. (On that note: boo on Google Maps for not allowing you to set pagination specifics!)</strike> <strong>EDIT:</strong> Apparently supplying a link to a KMZ file in the Google Maps search field gives you all regions. <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_5780561_use-kmz-file-google-maps.html">Hat-tip to this eHow article&hellip;</a></p>

<p>All boundaries courtesy of <a href="http://mapit.mysociety.org">mapit.mysociety.org</a>; all I really did was save each of their KML files and compile them together as a folder in Google Earth. Nothing too crazy-difficult, but hopefully should save somebody half an hour further down the road.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>The <a href="www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/WDR-2011.html">UNODC&rsquo;s yearly World Drug Report</a> is always a fun piece of data to play with. For my data journalism course, I&rsquo;ve used some of their stats to visualize aspects of it.</p>

<p>Below I&rsquo;ve done a bubble chart showing consumption data. The size of the bubble shows total regional consumption, while each slice shows regional consumption of each drug.</p>

<p>What does any of it mean? Well, two really obvious things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Cannabis is the world&rsquo;s illicit drug of choice.</li>
<li>North America consumes way, <em>way</em> more drugs than anywhere else.</li>
</ol>

<p>For another, I visualized where all the opium production in Afghanistan for 2010 is located:</p>

<h4>Notes:</h4>

<ul>
<li>The global drug consumption visualization sses lower estimates. For a chart that displays both, see: <a href="http://www-958.ibm.com/software/data/cognos/manyeyes/visualizations/global-drug-consumption-by-region">Global drug consumption by region 2011</a>.</li>
<li>Opiate estimates for Europe &ndash; where countries reported only opioid estimates &ndash; were derived by using the distribution of opiate users within the overall number of opioid users in treatment.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cocaine:</strong>

<li>“Anything that tends to lower the reputation of an individual amongst right thinking people or damages them in their trade or profession.”</li>
<li>Anything <strong>negative</strong> in a broad sense.</li>
<li>Examples:

<ul>
<li>Hypocrisy</li>
<li>Having an affair</li>
<li>Acting in an unprofessional manner</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>“At the heart of libel law is getting it right.”

<ul>
<li>Extreme requirement to be able to prove what you print.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Information has to be published to a third party to be libellous.

<ul>
<li>I.e., private emails not subject.</li>
<li>Substantial publication?

<ul>
<li> If published to a small group, less damaging

<ul>
<li> Jameel v. Dow Jones (2005)

<ul>
<li> Wall Street Journal allegation was seen by 5 people.

<ul>
<li> “It would be an abuse of process to commit so much of British law to such &hellip; when so little is at stake.”</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Burden of Proof

<ul>
<li>Claimant — that the article was published to a third party, claimant is reasonably identifiable and the article is defamatory</li>
<li>Defendant — that the statement was true.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Libel laws apply equally on the Internet as it does to other formats.

<ul>
<li> Are search engines considered publishers?

<ul>
<li>Metropolitan International Schools v. Design Technica, Google (2009)

<ul>
<li>Case thrown out because Google was a facilitator and not a publisher.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ISPs also exempt</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Godfrey v. Demon Internet (1999)

<ul>
<li>Academic asked for defamatory article be taken down, Demon took 10 days to comply.</li>
<li>Demon Internet able to argue “innocent dissemination”

<ul>
<li> Same argument as a newsstand not knowing what’s in every periodical</li>
<li> However, one notice of defamation is given, then on the hook.

<ul>
<li> Demon had to pay £15,000 in damages, but +£200,000 in legal</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Limitation period — 1 year from publication date.

<ul>
<li>If on the Internet, however, publication continues until 1 year after article is taken down.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Since introduction of conditional fees, anyone can sue for libel

<ul>
<li>Lawyer can take on case and take fee from defendant, in addition to an “uplift” fee due to risk inherent in taking case on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Repetition rule

<ul>
<li>If you’re repeating just what has been said elsewhere, you’re still on the hook.</li>
<li>Plus you can’t defend it since you have no evidence!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>defamatory statements

<ul>
<li>Libel — published in a permanent form. Broadcasting considered libel.</li>
<li>Slander — Transitory statements

<ul>
<li>Victoria Beckham implied items in shop were fake and press reported it; successfully sued for £45,000 in losses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Injunctions are rare

<ul>
<li>Rule against prior restraint

<ul>
<li>If a publisher plans to prove a statement is true then should not be banned from publishing.</li>
<li>Law accepts in the law of libel that courts do not stop publication except in rare and exceptional circumstances.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bonnard v. Perryman

<ul>
<li>Bonnard established that &ldquo;The right of free speech is one which it is for the public interest that individuals should posses, and indeed, that they should exercise without</li>

<li>Special damages where you can prove actual loss, plus damages for loss of general reputation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Individuals</p>

<ul>
<li>Not the dead</li>
<li>Groups of individuals

<ul>
<li>Showing a photo of identifiable people at club attached to article on drug use could lead to this.</li>
