Once it caught on, it caught on quickly. + Satisfied deep human desires for settlement and consistency + Division of power + Gradual erosion of power for centralized sources. + Gutenberg printing press disrupted the Catholic church’s control over the Christian faith. + Division of power has accelerated with the web + Near universal access to information, which can be freely shared with others + Cuts of middlemen + Anyone an express themselves and find an audience. + As a result: + Flattens hierarchical power structures + Capital and information flows are faster, more fluid and chaotic + Accelerating innovation + Impulse is to both create and consume. + Audience increasingly alienated by the mass market approach to media. + Moore’s law specifies the speed of processors double every 18 months, but also that the cost of technology decreases, space and bandwidth increase. + Disruptive models + Perrato Principle: + 80% of your profit will come from 20% of your inventory + Amazon undermined due to Toyatan retailing + Make more from selling misfires than hits (The Long Tail) + Music industry &mdash; failed to innovate because of rival subscription-based services with incomplete inventories and format wars + Apple rejected subscription model with iTunes by charging 99c per song, required individual songs to be sold instead of just whole albums + Google particularly disruptive + Google’s main service is search, which is made profitable by Adwords. + Made newspaper advertising seem incredibly expensive and unreliable + “Prisoner’s dilemma” &mdash; Google takes away advertising revenue and commodifies news, but to remove stories from its service is to lose traffic to rivals. + Value of information is near zero on Internet; key is to find value in other aspects of journalism + Fact verification, sourcing, fact aggregation, etc. Some innovators + Controlivest + Portuguese company + Gave away piece of silverware with each issue; missing an issue would mean having an incomplete set.

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>**UPDATED:** Now allows you to filter based on a comma-separated list of wards! More accurate application geolocation data based on eastings/northings! Wicked, yo! See below! Ever wanted a way to learn about planning applications and appeals in the London borough of Hackney? The borough council&rsquo;s website has an ASP-driven search tool for both applications and appeals, but no way to get the latest ones in something as convenient as an RSS feed. To this end I&rsquo;ve built two scrapers via [ScraperWiki](<a href="http://www.scraperwiki.com">http://www.scraperwiki.com</a>) ([Applications](<a href="https://scraperwiki.com/scrapers/hackney_planning_simpletest_browser_attempt_1/">https://scraperwiki.com/scrapers/hackney_planning_simpletest_browser_attempt_1/</a>) and [Appeals](<a href="https://scraperwiki.com/scrapers/hackney_planning_appeal_simpletest_browser/">https://scraperwiki.com/scrapers/hackney_planning_appeal_simpletest_browser/</a>)), which are feeding a [view](<a href="https://scraperwiki.com/views/hackney_council_planning_and_appeals_rss_output/">https://scraperwiki.com/views/hackney_council_planning_and_appeals_rss_output/</a>) outputting [GeoRSS](<a href="http://www.georss.org">http://www.georss.org</a>). To add it to Google Reader or another RSS-based tool: * For a combined listing of both applications and appeals, regardless of geolocation success, use: * <a href="https://views.scraperwiki.com/run/hackney_council_planning_and_appeals_rss_output/?">https://views.scraperwiki.com/run/hackney_council_planning_and_appeals_rss_output/?</a> * For just applications, use: * <a href="https://views.scraperwiki.com/run/hackney_council_planning_and_appeals_rss_output/?feed=applications">https://views.scraperwiki.com/run/hackney_council_planning_and_appeals_rss_output/?feed=applications</a> * For just appeals, use: * <a href="https://views.scraperwiki.com/run/hackney_council_planning_and_appeals_rss_output/?feed=appeals">https://views.scraperwiki.com/run/hackney_council_planning_and_appeals_rss_output/?feed=appeals</a> * **|New!** To return only records in specific wards, use ward=[comma-separated list of wards] * Example: <a href="https://views.scraperwiki.com/run/hackney_council_planning_and_appeals_rss_output/?wards=De%20Beauvoir,Olympic%20Development%20Authority">https://views.scraperwiki.com/run/hackney_council_planning_and_appeals_rss_output/?wards=De%20Beauvoir,Olympic%20Development%20Authority</a> * This returns all records that are either in De Beauvoir or through the Olympic Development Authority (Replace spaces with %20!) * To output only records with latitude/longitude data, add &amp;strict=true to the end. See note below. * Combined: <a href="https://views.scraperwiki.com/run/hackney_council_planning_and_appeals_rss_output/?strict=true">https://views.scraperwiki.com/run/hackney_council_planning_and_appeals_rss_output/?strict=true</a> * Just applications: <a href="https://views.scraperwiki.com/run/hackney_council_planning_and_appeals_rss_output/?feed=applications&amp;strict=true">https://views.scraperwiki.com/run/hackney_council_planning_and_appeals_rss_output/?feed=applications&amp;strict=true</a> * Just appeals: <a href="https://views.scraperwiki.com/run/hackney_council_planning_and_appeals_rss_output/?feed=appeals&amp;strict=true">https://views.scraperwiki.com/run/hackney_council_planning_and_appeals_rss_output/?feed=appeals&amp;strict=true</a> <strike>Note: I geolocate using ScraperWiki&rsquo;s built-in functions, which are dependent upon postal code. I may try to update the scrapers in the future to grab Eastings and Northings as applications related to sites without a postal code (for instance, those involving forthcoming Olympic sites) won&rsquo;t geocode and thus be omitted using the &ldquo;strict=true&rdquo; flag.</strike> I&rsquo;ve updated the script to grab eastings/northings for applications so they&rsquo;re way more accurate. Note that eastings/northings data is not available for appeals, which still use postal code geolocation and may thus be less accurate (Or lacking geolocation data in the unlikely event it&rsquo;s an appeal without a postal code.). To see how this could be used in a more interesting way than just Google Reader, check out this [RSSMapper Google Maps/geoRSS mashup](<a href="http://www.rssmapper.com/map/map?id=201112111844033">http://www.rssmapper.com/map/map?id=201112111844033</a>) I made. <strong>Special thanks to [Ross Jones](<a href="https://twitter.com/rossjones">https://twitter.com/rossjones</a>) who spent over an hour helping me figure out why my regex wouldn&rsquo;t work with the Hackney Council planning application search output.</strong></p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>As part of a project I&rsquo;m working on for the [Hackney Citizen](<a href="http://hackneycitizen.co.uk">http://hackneycitizen.co.uk</a>), I&rsquo;m creating a comprehensive map of a lot of different stuff going on in Hackney. One thing that would be particularly useful would be ward boundaries, ultimately comprising the area of the whole borough. Much to my surprise, I could not find a single omnibus Hackney ward shapefile anywhere online. Thus I&rsquo;ve created one, attached to this blog post. <br/>
<small><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=embed&hl=en&geocode=&q=http:%2F%2Fwww.aendrew.com%2Ffiles%2Fhackney_wards.kmz&aq=&sll=51.56319,-0.048871&sspn=0.008524,0.02193&vpsrc=0&ie=UTF8&t=m&ll=51.548799,-0.060519&spn=0.05797,0.087984" style="color:#0000FF;text-align:left">View Larger Map</a></small> <strike>Google Maps tops out at ~12 regions per page, so to get the entire borough you need to [download the full KMZ file](<a href="http://aendrew.com/sites/default/files/hackney_wards.kmz">http://aendrew.com/sites/default/files/hackney_wards.kmz</a>) and load it into Google Earth. Going to the [full map](<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=215653240665910605934.0004b39e926a519eded0c&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=51.546122,-0.060768&amp;spn=0.068215,0.175438&amp;iwloc=0004b39e94944f1f3f759">http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=215653240665910605934.0004b39e926a519eded0c&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=51.546122,-0.060768&amp;spn=0.068215,0.175438&amp;iwloc=0004b39e94944f1f3f759</a>) gives you pagination, though the effect is still kind of lost. (On that note: boo on Google Maps for not allowing you to set pagination specifics!)</strike> **EDIT:** Apparently supplying a link to a KMZ file in the Google Maps search field gives you all regions. [Hat-tip to this eHow article&hellip;](<a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_5780561_use-kmz-file-google-maps.html">http://www.ehow.com/how_5780561_use-kmz-file-google-maps.html</a>) All boundaries courtesy of [mapit.mysociety.org](<a href="http://mapit.mysociety.org">http://mapit.mysociety.org</a>); all I really did was save each of their KML files and compile them together as a folder in Google Earth. Nothing too crazy-difficult, but hopefully should save somebody half an hour further down the road. ## [Full Hackney ward boundary KMZ shapefile](<a href="http://aendrew.com/sites/default/files/hackney_wards.kmz">http://aendrew.com/sites/default/files/hackney_wards.kmz</a>) -Æ.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>The [UNODC&rsquo;s yearly World Drug Report](www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/WDR-2011.html) is always a fun piece of data to play with. For my data journalism course, I&rsquo;ve used some of their stats to visualize aspects of it. Below I&rsquo;ve done a bubble chart showing consumption data. The size of the bubble shows total regional consumption, while each slice shows regional consumption of each drug. What does any of it mean? Well, two really obvious things: 1. Cannabis is the world&rsquo;s illicit drug of choice. 2. North America consumes way, *way* more drugs than anywhere else. For another, I visualized where all the opium production in Afghanistan for 2010 is located: #### Notes: * The global drug consumption visualization sses lower estimates. For a chart that displays both, see: <a href="http://www-958.ibm.com/software/data/cognos/manyeyes/visualizations/global-drug-consumption-by-region">Global drug consumption by region 2011</a>. * Opiate estimates for Europe &ndash; where countries reported only opioid estimates &ndash; were derived by using the distribution of opiate users within the overall number of opioid users in treatment. * No data was available for the following: * **|Cocaine:\<em>* </em>| East Africa * Central Asia * South Asia * **|Amphetamines:\<em>* </em>| East Africa * North Africa * West and Central Africa * Central Asia * South Asia * **|Ecstasy:\<em>* </em>| East Africa * North Africa * West and Central Africa * Central Asia * South Asia * Near and Middle East * Cohorts lacking data should *not* be interpreted as having no users; rather, that the UNODC was not able to reliably estimate the number of users. <a href="http://www-958.ibm.com/software/data/cognos/manyeyes/datasets/fba0c28e0c6e11e18f0a000255111976/versions/1">(Full dataset at Manyeyes)</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>&hellip;Well, maybe next week we&rsquo;ll have a meeting at the scheduled time? Due to Greenslade cancelling his Monday lecture, we bumped up our meeting time to then and had a general discussion. ### Topics discussed (in no particular order): + Does Google Standout matter? + What does everyone think of iPad/iPhone-only publications like The Daily? ### Project ideas discussed: + iPad/iPhone app ### New project champions! + Andrew Stuart: [@AndrewRStuart](<a href="http://twitter.com/aendrewrstuart">http://twitter.com/aendrewrstuart</a>) + Rebecca Ratcliffe [@r_ratclif](<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/r_ratclif">http://twitter.com/#!/r_ratclif</a>) <em>(A project champion is a member who has stepped forward and said they&rsquo;ll both attend meetings and retweet information. Thanks to everyone who has volunteered!)</em> # We&rsquo;re still mostly talking about what we want out of this group and various other logistical aspects. If you&rsquo;re interested, please join us next week at Saddlers on Monday at 5!</p>
