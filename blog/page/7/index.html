  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Press Gazette editor Dominic Ponsford with&hellip; ## John Kay, chief reporter, The Sun * Qualities: * Dogged determination * Ability to think on feet at lightning pace and tenacity * Direct route &mdash; graduate traineeship; must have 100 wpm shorthand. 180 reporters get whittled down to 4. * Local newspaper route &mdash; work at a small paper for awhile. * News agency &mdash; Southwestern Bristol; INS in Redding. Pays peanuts and has tonnes of work, but one gets experience. * Or just get exclusive stories. Meet as many people as possible, talk to as many people as possible, make as many contacts as possible. * Best part of job is getting to the office and having no idea what you&rsquo;re going to do that day. ## Karl Schneider, editorial development director, Reed Business Information (large B2B mag/web publisher) * Qualities: * Rat-like determination * Passion for your topics * Willingness to share * Opportunities to shape the profession have never been greater. * 75% of revenue is from online &mdash; unique to B2B. * With B2B, it&rsquo;s very much about your community. * If you&rsquo;re passionate about something, the chance to get paid for covering it is a fantastic privilege, and is possible usually *because* you&rsquo;re passionate about it. * If you&rsquo;re faking it, that generally comes across pretty quickly. * Ways B2B makes money * Ads content * Paying users (over half) * Targeted advertising (possible due to the kinds of audience) * Online advertising * Smart: using crowdsourcing to simultaneously gather data while using it to improve targeting. * Having to be willing to learn new things all the time; knowledge of HTML/CSS important * The tools you need are free; this is a dramatic change. * If you come to a publisher saying you&rsquo;re passionate about telling stories and you&rsquo;re not doing it (via a blog, for instance), the publisher will question your honesty when all the tools are freely available. * &ldquo;If you want to get into journalism into any sector &mdash; just go do it. You&rsquo;ll get attention.&rdquo; ## Chris Wimpress, political editor, Huffington Post UK * &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t have a blog and are writing about stuff on your own time, then you should start doing it.&rdquo; * You need to show tenacity; you might have absolutely no traffic for months, but keep at it. * The Lobby &mdash; group of journalists allowed to attend meetings with the PM&rsquo;s communications people. * &ldquo;I really hope that anyone who&rsquo;s wanting to work in political journalism &hellip; makes that process irrelevant.&rdquo; * In response to criticism that HuffPo reduces the value of the written word, argues he&rsquo;d rather many people earn less than * Apparently Guido Fawkes sells the IP addresses of people in gov for targeted advertising. * Getting a job: * Don&rsquo;t listen to what anyone says about there not being jobs. * Show you have something different and interesting. * Intern recently hired was an English grad with a massive network of relevant contacts in the banking industry. * It&rsquo;s really difficult to specialize if all you know how to do is be a journalist. Consider what kind of journalism you want to do and how you can start doing it. ## Gaz Corfield, Editor of The West Londoner blog * Got 3 million pageviews in that many days for blog * Started a news WP blog about west London with FB and Twitter set up through Bit.ly * Got a bunch of hits&hellip; Then the riots happened. * Got 1500 pageviews for initial riot coverage. * Started liveblogging and got a million page hits that day. * Using Tweetdeck exclusively to cover; an update ever 90 seconds or so. * Used location-based tweets to curate content. * What separated from mainstream media was: 1. First 2. Fastest 3. Everyone admitted they were first and fastest. * Has started to get responses as a result. ### Q&amp;A period #### How to get work experience * Schneider &mdash; ask him or an editor * Kay &mdash; Murdoch scholarship * Wimpress &mdash; Do **NOT** write a &ldquo;Dear Sir/Madame, &hellip; I HAVE to do an internship, therefore I&rsquo;m applying, here&rsquo;s my CV.&rdquo; #### How to stand out? * Use your initiative #### What kind of blog should you have? * Nobody really cares about personal blogs * Show that you can drive traffic #### Importance of journalism degrees? * Immaterial; what&rsquo;s important is the core journalism skills. * None of the panelists have one. #### Getting into the Guardian/big papers * Wimpress &mdash; Just keep hammering away at the specific portion you&rsquo;re interested in. #### Important of shorthand? * Kay &mdash; absolutely from an operational standpoint, though validity of shorthand notes is being questioned legally. Always have a tape backup. * Wimpress &mdash; Only has really needed it about 5 times, and those five times he *really* wished he had it. * Schneider &mdash; Ability to effectively and quickly tweet more important. #### What if you&rsquo;re bad at telling stories? * Kay &mdash; Getting story more important than writing it. Gold standard is getting the story in the first place. * Ponsford &mdash; It&rsquo;s useless to have a room full of people who can write beautiful prose but nothing to write about. #### Not sure what the last question was, but some points: * Schneider &mdash; Many ways to monetize stuff; just try some. * Ponsford &mdash; Having to report in the &ldquo;ass end of nowhere&rdquo; is really useful for learning story development skills</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><h2>Why are sources important, and how does one deal with them? * Sources are sources for a reason &mdash; they know things the rest of the world doesn&rsquo;t * Good journalism shouldn&rsquo;t be straight quoting a source; some analysis is needed. * Journalists as a conduit (sewage pipe) * Yes, they relay things, but good journalism should process the &ldquo;sewage&rdquo; * &ldquo;Our single essential journalism aim is to try to tell the truth &mdash; it also means we should never tell an untruth, or do anything that is likely to mislead.&rdquo; * This is frankly more important than any attempt at objectivity (though that&rsquo;s still something journalists should strive for) * How do remain impartial when we have multiple sources with different viewpoints, and especially with editors and others arguing a certain way? * Good reading: <em>&ldquo;The Elements of Journalism&rdquo;,</em> Bill Kovach and Tom Rosenstiel * The essence of journalism is to build up the picture of the truth through one&rsquo;s sources. * Lippmann &mdash; newsmakers must get over the &ldquo;pictures in their heads.&rdquo; * The method is objective, not the journalist. * General problems people have with journalism isn&rsquo;t objectivity but *accuracy*. * Five core concepts: 1. Never add anything that was not there before 2. Never deceive the audience 3. Be as transparent as possible about your methods and motives 4. Rely on your own original reporting 5. Exercise humility * Don&rsquo;t trick sources &mdash; they won&rsquo;t be sources again. * Use single-sourcing regularly and with great care. * Even the most honest single source can be wrong, and it&rsquo;s not a story until you&rsquo;ve receive a response from other stories * Blair funeral story * How do we ever get at the truth without sacrificing our principles? Is it ever justified to lie to a source, or use subterfuge? Are these tactics proportionate to the importance of the story? Is it justifiable to pay for information; to invade a person&rsquo;s privacy? Is it ever justified to reveal the identity of a source who wishes to remain anonymous and you&rsquo;ve given your word to keep anonymous? How do we read between the lines when PR people want to give &ldquo;guidance&rdquo;? * Without people telling us things they know about, there wouldn&rsquo;t be many stories. * Many of these people wish to remain in the shadows and off the record * &ldquo;Revelatory stories just wouldn&rsquo;t exist if we couldn&rsquo;t get people talking.&rdquo; * Sources have to believe we&rsquo;ll honour their right to anonymity. * Yet there&rsquo;s a tendency to overuse anonymous sources * In Britain, no journalist has the right to keep a source from the editor * Accept there&rsquo;s a need to expose your source to at least one other person. * Journalists must not use anonymity to exaggerate what&rsquo;s been said. * &ldquo;When we accept off-the-record briefings, we enter into a contract of confidentiality with the source and we therefore publish in good faith. But if we find that we have been deliberately lied to, then any obligation of confidence is removed. Source have to know that the threat of exposure hangs over them.&rdquo; &mdash; Jeff Randall, <em>Sunday Times</em> * Hard to get up-to-date sources and info from intelligence agencies; difficulty in dealing with spooks * &ldquo;Sourcing is entirely unremarkable.&rdquo; * People in a non-journalistic world are already aware that they receive unattributable briefings that don&rsquo;t cause any trouble. * A father warning children mother&rsquo;s in a bad mood, &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t tell her I said so.&rdquo; Parties concerned understand necessity of confidentiality. * Not that big of a leap to the level of secrecy journalists regularly use. * <strong>|Gilligan Affair</strong> &mdash; May 2003, claims that one of the justifications for war &mdash; i.e., Saddam Hussein&rsquo;s ownership of WMDs &mdash; was not as true as initially suggested, and certainly not within 45 minutes as suggested by Blair. * Andrew Gilligan suggests that he has a source believing the prime minister had &ldquo;sexed up&rdquo; the dossier that convinced Britain to go to war, the government knew Saddam didn&rsquo;t have them and couldn&rsquo;t deploy within 45 minutes. * Source (Dr. David Kelly?) was a biological weapons expert, would have been known immediately. Gave impression that source was in government (and not simply just a bio-weapons expert). * Kelly was so embarrassed by the situation he voluntarily outed himself to the MOD. * Was called before parliamentary committee and grilled hardcore; committed suicide afterward. * Gilligan dismissed from the BBC; based story on poor note-taking, misrepresenting source. Two senior BBC staff resigned. * Good reporter, good source, accurate information &mdash; but mishandling was disastrous. * **|Watergate:**, Deepthroat was never identified; just pointed them towards another source. * In Britain, most briefs can&rsquo;t be verified in this way. * Rules of thumb: * Is this a professional relationship or is it a friend? * Has this person given credible information in the past? * Can you check at least a bit of it? * Only two journalists in England have gone to jail in the last 60 years for refusing to reveal a source; one in Ireland. * **|1963** &mdash; period of incredible belief the USSR would bring down democracy. Spy found in British admiralty, Bassat. * Tribunal &ndash; asked where they got their sources. Two journalists sent to jail. * Senior judge: &ldquo;There is no privilege known to law by which a journalist in front of an inquiry can refuse to answer the question of a judge.&rdquo; * Irish reporter wouldn&rsquo;t reveal an IRA member. Spent 4 days in jail, never named his source ever. * <strong>|Tisdall Affair:</strong> In 80s, a envelope full of documents re: US nuclear weapons arriving on British shores and government reaction to protests was dropped on Guardian&rsquo;s front door. * Government demanded the documents, threatened to fine on a daily basis via contempt of court under the Official Secrets Act. * Eventually Guardian caved, gave documents. Source was found out, spent 6 months in jail. * <strong>|Interbrew case:*<em> </em>| Internal documents leaked, Interbrew wanted whistleblower. UK courts sided with whistleblower, eventually went to European Court of Human Rights. Interbrew eventually dropped case. * </strong>|Goodwin case:*<em> </em>| Journalist refused to reveal source, kept refusing to reveal source and was charged with contempt of court. * Went to the European Court of Human Rights, which sided with Goodwin under Article 10. * <em><em>|Guardian and Milly Dowler case:*</em> </em>| Met tried to charge journalists under Official Secrets Act to reveal sources. * As a general rule of thumb, paying sources is not a good idea. * Naturally biases sources. * Will say what you want them.</h2>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><h3>Update: Sun., October 30. First meeting Tues., November 1st at Saddlers Bar on campus! There&rsquo;s been a bit of interest, but I&rsquo;m still looking for 3-4 other people to champion this idea. Again &mdash; minimal time involvement, help start something cool, learn new tech skills and be able to put &ldquo;co-founder&rdquo; on your resume! [&hellip;] I initially was wanting to start a [City Spark](<a href="http://www.city.ac.uk/for-business/innovation-and-growth-support/entrepreneurship/cityspark-business-plan-competition">http://www.city.ac.uk/for-business/innovation-and-growth-support/entrepreneurship/cityspark-business-plan-competition</a>) group to brainstorm ideas to improve journalism technology, with the goal of entering the best idea into the competition and perhaps eventually the [Knight News Challenge](<a href="http://knightfoundation.org/funding-initiatives/knight-news-challenge/">http://knightfoundation.org/funding-initiatives/knight-news-challenge/</a>). Despite some initial interest, I quickly got the impression that most people in my programme are just too damned busy to craft a finely-tuned proposal and do all sorts of stuff that&rsquo;s interesting to MBA students but not interesting in the slightest for journalism majors. Thus, I propose something better: CULJTEG! ##WTF is CULJTEG? CULJTEG, or the City University London Journalism Technology Exploration Group (and trust me, I&rsquo;d **love** for somebody to come up with a better acronym than this), would be a monthly meetup group emphasizing innovating the use of technology within the journalism field. We&rsquo;d essentially meet for an hour or two the first Tuesday of every month at Saddler&rsquo;s Bar or where-ever to discuss things that bug us about technology â and, more importantly, ways to make that technology work *better*. Some months we&rsquo;d just have an open discussion; others, we could have a specific goal, whether that&rsquo;s to run a workshop (I&rsquo;d be happy to spend an hour or two teaching folks how to make their portfolio site really sizzle) or brainstorm ways to build some highly-disruptive technology before letting it loose on the London media environment. It doesn&rsquo;t even have to get that technical &mdash; if nothing else, we could just use the hour to expend huge amounts of public resources by making a bunch of FoI requests through [WhatDoTheyKnow.com](<a href="http://www.whatdotheyknow.com">http://www.whatdotheyknow.com</a>). <em>&ldquo;Dear Islington Council &mdash; what taxpayer funds are spent on toilet paper every year? And is Islington Town Hall single-ply or double-ply&hellip;?&rdquo;</em> You get the idea. If we&rsquo;re going to do this, I want at least three other people to champion the idea. This would mean you&rsquo;d try to be at every meeting &mdash; even if you&rsquo;re *really* not feeling it that Tuesday &mdash; and would promote it to others via the usual channels. If this sounds like something you&rsquo;d be interested in doing, please either contact me on Twitter (@aendrew) or leave a comment below.</h3>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p><em>To preface this, I&rsquo;ve never liveblogged a lecture and figure this would be a good place to start. Note that my Macbook Pro is getting old and I can only manage about an hour and a half of battery life, which might make this a touch challenging when combined with the non-functional power outlets in the Oliver Thompson Lecture Theatre. Please be kind&hellip;</em> For more information &mdash; <a href="http://www.city.ac.uk/events/2011/oct/heather-brook-civic-journalism-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters">http://www.city.ac.uk/events/2011/oct/heather-brook-civic-journalism-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters</a> #Civic Journalism and Why It Matters ##Heather Brooke + &ldquo;When profit becomes the core function of the news business .. then it loses its public purpose.&rdquo; + Governments suffer from this too. + Reading list: &ldquo;Reporter&rsquo;s Handbook&rdquo;, &ldquo;My Traitor&rsquo;s Heart&rdquo; &mdash; Rian Malan (Journalism as a way to change society.) + Malan: &ldquo;Next to joining the underground, journalism was the most honourable calling for a white leftist.&rdquo; + &ldquo;That whole desire to change the world has been usurped by &hellip; marketing.&rdquo; + &ldquo;The ultimate moral bankruptcy of modern journalism is it&rsquo;s forgotten its core purpose of informing the public.&rdquo; + Example: Iceland. Financial elite comprises no more than 30 people; 2008, country goes bankrupt. Attempts to investigate were met with silence and figure pointing. Felt betrayed by the banks, the politicians and the media. Came to associate secrecy as the ultimate sin; has become the testing ground for &ldquo;radical transparency.&rdquo; + Lack of reporting in courts. + Royal Courts: used to have 25 dedicated court reporters. + Today: 4; 2 at the Old Bailey + PA Survey of magistrates&#8217; court clerks: 79.3% of justices&#8217; clerks who responded said local newspaper coverage of the courts in their area had declined. + Only 13.8% said it had remained the same. + 64.5% said they rarely saw a reporter in court, + 29% said they sometimes saw a reporter + 6.5% said they often saw one. + 98% said they believed it was very important or fairly important for local communities to know what was happening in the courts. + Police able to control the flow of information. Guardian found it difficult to get information on people who&rsquo;ve been charged during the riots. + Clerks wouldn&rsquo;t allow access to court records. + Wanted access to court register database, couldn&rsquo;t access. + Were eventually able to get access to some of the datasets via Ministry of Justice, eventually started to cross-reference addresses of those charged with riot locations. + Access to the court registers had never been requested before &mdash; whaaaat?! + &ldquo;Your Right to Know&rdquo; written in response to that and the bureaucracy that prevents journalists from holding power to account. + Police incidence reports, fire inspection reports, parliament still not public. + &ldquo;If you want to really shake up the system [and fulfill your role as a journalist] &hellip; then you have to invest in fighting for the information that&rsquo;s really powerful.&rdquo; + &ldquo;If the information was easy to get, everyone would have it.&rdquo; + Young people disillusioned because they don&rsquo;t see the media as representing their interests. + &ldquo;The Occupied Wall Street Journal&rdquo; &mdash; Kickstarter project created in response to lack of media coverage of the Occupy Wall Street protests. + The Uptake&rsquo;s tagline &mdash; &ldquo;Will journalism be done by you or to you?&rdquo; + &ldquo;We need to remember who we are and what our public purpose is, and then maybe we can take back those words from Levis.&rdquo; ###Q&amp;A Segment + How did we get to the state we are in journalism? + &ldquo;We treat journalism like any other business, like a widget in a factory. &hellip; News is just not like that.&rdquo; + &ldquo;The demise of civic is across the sector, it&rsquo;s not just journalism.&rdquo; We no longer view civic world in which we live as actually ours. + Most shocking revelation from MP expense scandal? + No one single thing; just the amount of resources poured into keeping that information secret. + Do journalists need social movements? + Yes; most journalists start for idealistic reasons, need support group to continue fulfilling the public interest. + How do you reconcile doing open journalism with having the kinds of networks that makes journalists special? + &ldquo;The most protected thing is British society is the name of somebody who holds power.&rdquo; + These people can&rsquo;t be protected behind a wall of bureaucracy if using open journalism techniques. + How to target FoI requests? + Know what you&rsquo;re looking for! If you do, you&rsquo;ll often find it. + Don&rsquo;t journalists exist in secrecy networks as well? + Well, sometimes &mdash; you don&rsquo;t want to endanger a source or harm somebody. + But confidential sources are used too often in lazy journalism. + Are your criticisms of the British press related to its self-regulation? + No; the press has a relationship with the public. The reason it&rsquo;s self-regulating is that if people can&rsquo;t connect with a news service, they lose interest. + The problem with the phone hacking is that the police knew this had occurred, but they both obfuscated it and did nothing about it. + Subsidizing journalism? + Norway has a big, relevant newspaper market &mdash; and it&rsquo;s subsidized. + Might not work great in Britain, but we *ARE* subsidizing the press, much of which is free sheet propaganda. + If we are going to subsidize media, let&rsquo;s give it to an independent media. + Why are you against Wikileaks? + Not anti-Wikileaks philosophy; anti-Julian Assange. + &ldquo;Morally bankrupt individual who has completely used that organization to protect his own reputation &mdash; which leaves a lot to be desired.&rdquo; + But what about withholding information during court cases, where it may endanger investigations (i.e., police incidence reports)? + If it will hamper an investigation, police won&rsquo;t release it anyway. + Police incidence reports considered public information anyway; or you can go to the station and read arrest reports, but you have to be morally coherent about what you publish in order to maintain audience. + When journalists have to face the consequences of what they publish, it becomes a self-regulating system. + (Some guy talking about the student newspaper FoI&#8217;ing City University stuff, and how it should be done more often.) + Difference between British and US universities; much more acceptable for US student newspapers to FoI their parent universities. + It seems there&rsquo;s a weird dialectic, with journalists failing their democratic function while the internet democratizes media&hellip; + Everybody can be a journalist, but the professional journalist&rsquo;s currency is their reputation. We have citizen journalists, but more than ever do professional journalists matter. + How should the cable leaks have been handled? + Similar to the MP expenses story; leaked by a whistleblower to a paper. Information broker was never the story &mdash; it was about the information itself. All the gravity of the MP expense story stayed with the story; the cable leaks focused too much on Assange. + What should journalism ultimately be? + Too much is churnalism; too little going out and finding out information from first principles. + Not just to inform and entertain, but the fact book of how we all want to live together. + Where is good journalism being done? + Everywhere! + Was in South Africa and although good journalism is going on there, people still perceive that it&rsquo;s not. + In Kenya to combat corruption, journalists would photograph any politician getting out of a car to the point that they created a law preventing photoing such. + Journalism is about the people who practice it, and they can be anywhere in the world.

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Good data journalism ultimately makes a story more accessible to an audience, and ties together threads one might not normally see. Here are two examples, one UK and one not. ##&ldquo;[Britistics](<a href="http://www.behance.net/gallery/Britistics-a-UK-Infographics/1457231">http://www.behance.net/gallery/Britistics-a-UK-Infographics/1457231</a>)&rdquo;, 2011, Matthew Rowett [Britistics](<a href="http://www.behance.net/gallery/Britistics-a-UK-Infographics/1457231">http://www.behance.net/gallery/Britistics-a-UK-Infographics/1457231</a>) is an attempt to visualize of a bunch of compiled data from sources such as the UK Office for National Statistics and OnePoll. It uses a lot of nice iconography to represent various facts about life in Britain. I appreciate the variety of the stats; they include everything from tidy depictions of political participation, to an incredible amount of information about socks. While most of the stats are quite interesting, I was somewhat confused by the second page, &ldquo;If the UK were 100 people.&rdquo; In one section, it talks about livestock, giving the figure of 17 cows. Maybe I was just viewing this while tired, but it took me a second to figure out that was supposed to read &ldquo;.17 cows per person comprising 1% of the British population.&rdquo; What does that even mean, though? ##[&ldquo;Remembering Toronto&rsquo;s Fallen from World War II&rdquo;](<a href="http://www.openfile.ca/toronto/file/2010/11/remembering-torontos-fallen-world-war-ii">http://www.openfile.ca/toronto/file/2010/11/remembering-torontos-fallen-world-war-ii</a>), 2010, Patrick Cain ([OpenFile Toronto](<a href="http://toronto.openfile.ca">http://toronto.openfile.ca</a>)) The [Poppy File](<a href="http://www.openfile.ca/remembrance_day">http://www.openfile.ca/remembrance_day</a>) was a project by OpenFile Toronto to commemorate Remembrance Day last year. It was one of the data visualization projects that got my initially excited about OpenFile, in that it combined some very in-depth reporting with some interesting data journalism. Particularly interesting is Patrick Cain&rsquo;s &ldquo;Remembering Toronto&rsquo;s Fallen from World War II&rdquo; project, which used a civic data collection project from WWII to visualize the impact of war on a community. Essentially, Toronto City Hall used newspaper ads and casualty lists to create a record for each serviceman from Toronto killed during the conflict â a record currently comprising 12 boxes in the city&rsquo;s archives. The index cards on which this data was written also listed the address of the deceased&rsquo;s next-of-kin, from which Cain has built his map. My one criticism with the interactive map is that the poppies don&rsquo;t really scale properly at the lower zoom levels, to such a point it looks like one big glob when zoomed to its extents. The poppies should scale proportionally to the map, such that they&rsquo;re just tiny points when more fully zoomed out.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>I have way too much social media property, and it&rsquo;s all set up in such a way that I&rsquo;m never quite sure what&rsquo;s going to go where, or whether content&rsquo;s going to get duplicated somewhere. To this end, I&rsquo;m using this post to refine my social media strategy and also let people folks know where any content is going to be. Writing â Where I&rsquo;ve posted text content has always been a mess. Between all of the different iterations of aendrew.com, my tumblog, Facebook and all the periodicals I&rsquo;ve written for, it&rsquo;s really hard to keep track of it all. With this in mind, I&rsquo;m retiring my Tumblog (at least until I can find an actual use for it &mdash; maybe photoblogging?), not writing any further notes on Facebook and posting all personal blog content on aendrew.com. My published work will still be all over the place, but I hope to start aggregating it somewhere on aendrew.com. I will also use my [Twitter account](<a href="http://www.twitter.com/aendrew">http://www.twitter.com/aendrew</a>) solely for posting journalism and web-development microblogs. Links â Linking is something similarly confusing in how I approach it. I post links on Facebook, Google+, Twitter and other places. I hope to consolidate this all into one [Delicious](<a href="http://www.delicious.com/aendrew">http://www.delicious.com/aendrew</a>) account, that will feed Facebook, Twitter and Google+. Photos â I&rsquo;ve always used Flickr as my main repository for my professional photography, with Facebook storing less-than-professional photography. I plan to keep my Facebook albums semi-private, with my Flickr account feeding Ã¦ndrew.com, Twitter and Facebook. Video â I have both a [YouTube](<a href="http://youtube.com/aendrew">http://youtube.com/aendrew</a>) and [Vimeo](<a href="http://www.vimeo.com/aendrew">http://www.vimeo.com/aendrew</a>) account, and I&rsquo;m not entirely sure how I plan to use either. I&rsquo;ve really only used YouTube for some short video sharing, mostly related to random web-dev projects, so I think I&rsquo;ll use YouTube for fun stuff and video art, with Vimeo reserved for more professional journalism projects. Code â I&rsquo;ve always used some kind of local repo for my public code, which is a really bad idea for a number of reasons I won&rsquo;t get into here (Well, briefly: if I switched CMSes, such as I did recently and do frequently, there&rsquo;s a lot more migration that needs to be done.). To this end, I&rsquo;m now using [Launchpad](<a href="http://www.launchpad.net/~aendrew">http://www.launchpad.net/~aendrew</a>) for all public code. Eventually I&rsquo;ll start posting into my sandbox on [Drupal.org](<a href="http://drupal.org/user/817398">http://drupal.org/user/817398</a>), but that will probably just sync with my code on Launchpad. Any thoughts? Apologies to any of my audience who may get confused by this all.</p>
