(2011) &mdash; Supreme Court + Upholds and restates the Reynolds Defence. + Article allegations that a British security company with wealthy Russian clients paid for sensitive information about extraditions + Subject to a libel complaint from police officer named. Flood was exonerated, so was pressing for libel. + Judges came down on side of the Times; argued it was in the public interest for story to be published. + &ldquo;Story told was high public interest&rdquo; &mdash; argued if Flood were not named, other members of the extradition unit would come under public scrutiny. # Copyright Law + Purpose + Designed to ensure those who create copyright works — photographs, film footage, books, etc. — are rewarded for their labours. + Incentivizes creative work. + Tangible form + No copyright in ideas — has to be created before it gets copyright. + No copyright in facts + Hughie Green v. NZ Broadcasting (1989) — elements of original programming in a knockoff in New Zealand. &ldquo;Nobody owns the rights to a talent contest.&rdquo; + Norowozian v. Arks (1999) — A Guinness advert using a technique (&ldquo;jump cutting&rdquo;) and dance style was similar to that used in the plaintiff&rsquo;s film. Court ruled nobody owns a dance style or film technique. + Physical ownership v copyright + Approached as a property right (Specifically intellectual property) + If you receive a letter, copyright rests with the letter writer — not the receiver. + Copyrights in a news report + No need for a registration + You don&rsquo;t have to register work to have a copyright on something. No &ldquo;copyright register&rdquo;. Work automatically gains protection, even without the © + Breach — substantial use + &ldquo;What is worth copying is worth protecting&rdquo; — principle ## Who owns it? + Author &mdash; if you&rsquo;re independent, then you own the copyright. + Employees &mdash; if you&rsquo;re employed by someone, then it&rsquo;s your employer who owns the copyright. + Freelancers &mdash; you generally own the copyright; newspapers now generally have a provision allowing reproduction of a piece bought from a freelancer online, etc. + Robin Ray v. Classic FM (1998) &mdash; asked to create an internal system for classifying music work. Radio station then tried to sell system to others; court ruled Classic FM wasn&rsquo;t allowed to sell Ray&rsquo;s work without permission. + Assignment &mdash; Who owns the copyright? + License &mdash; What is the breadth of the license? Single use, only on TV, on the Internet, both? For a time length or Into perpetuity? Where is this usage allowed? ## Length of copyright + Creative works: 70 years from end of year author died + If author unknown, 70 years from end of year of publication + Sound recordings / broadcast: 50 years from end of year of first publication + If it involves, say, a song with lyrics, the lyrics will be copyrighted as per the above (I.e., 70 years). ## Legal events + §30 CopyrighT Designs and Patents Act 1988 + &ldquo;Fair dealing&rdquo; provision places reporting current events about the interest of a copyright owner. + &ldquo;Fair dealing with a work other than a photograph for the purpose of reporting events does not infringe any copyright in the work, so long as it is accompanied by a sufficient acknowledgment.&rdquo; + What is fair? + Simply lifting content isn&rsquo;t fair; not giving a credit isn&rsquo;t fair. + Using material as wallpaper isn&rsquo;t fair. + Time Warner Co V. Channel Four Television (1994) + Over 80% of Clockwork Orange was shown in a programme on Channel 4; court ruled in favour of Channel 4 despite lack of permission. + Pro Seiben v. Carlton UK TV (1999) + Carlton UK TV was doing programme on chequebook journalism and used clip from Pro Seiben exclusive; ruled on side of Carlton. + Exclusivity + Less likely to be fair is just used to &ldquo;yank rug out&rdquo; from under a competitor. + Motive + Informational + Restrictions + Credit + Does not apply to stills. + Fair dealing for criticism, review + Public interest defence? + Paddy Ashdown v. Telegraph — Telegraph had published snippet from plaintiff&rsquo;s unpublished autobiography; court ruled there was a public interest due to it soon coming out. + Damages — market rate/aggravated + Paid in terms of market rate; more in aggravated circumstances (photo stolen) + Release forms — important; allows you to use their footage forevermore. + Sports footage — if showing footage, normally able to use 60 seconds with credit. If a series of matches (I.e., World Cup or something), increases to 90 seconds. + Internet — copyright applies as much as anywhere else. If using someone else&rsquo;s photo, you have to seek permission. + § 58 Copyright and Design Act + If someone giving a speech, you&rsquo;re generally allowed to report it without permission.</h2>

Will be replaced by&hellip; something. + Jeffries case: Mirror and Sun were prosecuted for contempt; Mirror sought appeal and was turned down # Confidentiality/Privacy ## Major cases + Douglas v. Hallo (2000) + Wedding between Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas. Had sold rights to Ok magazine; rival Hallo had photographer who surreptitiously took photos as part of wedding party. Douglases sued for breach of confidence; court upheld the right of the Douglases to protect their wedding. Court argued law of privacy would uphold law of confidentiality; duty of confidentiality didn&rsquo;t need to be identified. Setting was private, info had a commercial value &mdash; injunction would be granted. + Theakston v. MGN Ltd (2002): photographs + TV star visited brothel; story was told about exploits. Injunction sought, not granted about an account of what happened, though injunction granted against photographs being published. + &ldquo;Photographs can be particularly intrusive, particularly if not done with consent.&rdquo; + Peck v. UK (2003): privacy in a public place + Person tried to commit suicide, picture being prevented given to media, ECHR came down on his side and the council had acted inappropriately in providing photos to media. + Princess Caroline von Hannover v. Germany (2004) + Argued pictures taken of her were not of public interest and she was being harassed. ECHR came down on Princess Caroline von Hannover&rsquo;s side. + Naomi Campbell v. MGN Ltd (2004) (**the** major case re: privacy) + Campbell sued over report in Daily Mirror talking about her treatments for drug addiction. Report showed a photo of her leaving therapy session and gave details about therapy; frequency of therapy. Went to House of Lords, which came down 3-2 in favour of Campbell saying it was acceptable to publish details of drug treatment and to say she had a drug problem, but not acceptable to say she was going to Narcotics Anonymous, or where the treatment, or the kind of treatment; also, unacceptable to show photos of her leaving Narcotics Anonymous. Termed &ldquo;Wrongful disclosure of private information&rdquo;. Looks at the following: a. Is it private information? b. If disclosure took place, would it cause substantial offence to a reasonable person? c. What are the benefits of disclosure? d. Where does the public interest lie? + Lady Justice Hale: distinction being made between coming out from treatment or going about their normal business. + McKennitt v. Ash (2005) + Brought privacy to another level; a Canadian singer (Lorraine McKennitt) had book written about her by friend. Discussed things only a friend would be aware of. + Court sided with McKennitt; argued she was entitled to protect this information and friend didn&rsquo;t have right to publish it. In judgement itself, not made clear what was true or not; court said it wasn&rsquo;t for the claimant to sift through information to discriminate against what is true or not as that would undermine privacy further. + Murray v. Big Pictures (2008) + JK Rowling followed around Edinburgh with child in a pram; injunction sought to prevent photographs to pursue her. + Court granted, arguing special protection granted to children. + Max Mosley v. News Group Newspapers Ltd (2008) + Sued over NOTW articles suggesting he had been involved in Nazi-themed sex parties. + Judge came down arguing on the facts that there wasn&rsquo;t evidence the party was Nazi themed. If it was, there would be public interest. + Mosley then argued to the ECHR he should be aware of articles coming out about him, but ECHR argued he didn&rsquo;t have a right to be able to step in an attempt to stop publication. No right for claimant to be told about matter relating to privacy prior to publication. + LNS v. Persons Unknown (2010) + Footballer (John Terry) tried to create a blanket injunction about an affair. Came down against Terry, arguing he was doing this only to protect commercial interests. + Super injunctions + Trafigura v. Guardian Newspapers + Guardian had info re: Trafigura&rsquo;s toxic waste. Court imposed injunction on publication, but also on publication of information about injunction. + MP argued there shouldn&rsquo;t be a superinjunction; injunction unraveled and information because public. + Ferdinand v. MGN Ltd (2011) + Rio brought a case against Mirror; Mirror had published details about an affair. Judge Nichol came down on side of newspaper. + Ferdinand was the head of English football team; had tried to establish reputation as a reformed character (even having written an autobiography); lady had a right to tell story. + Spelman v. Express Newspapers Ltd + Newspaper got paper about rugby player (son of MP) had been ordering illegal performance enhancing drugs. Injunction initially granted then revoked; argued info was in the public domain. + Princess Caroline von Hannover (2012) + Case showed her and her family walking through the streets of Monaco with father, Prince Rainier, who had been ill. Law came down on side of press, arguing showing a reigning monarch in recovery was in the public interest. + Human Rights Act §12(3) + No injunction should be granted unless applicant is likely to win its case. + Media has to be given notice of applicantions + Much lower test than in libel (I.e., Bonnard v. Perryman), where it would be granted only if applicant is able to establish the falsity of the claims. # The Right to Life + Article 2 &mdash; Everyone&rsquo;s right to life should be protected by law. Everyone&rsquo;s life should be protected by the law, except in the case of capital punishment. + An absolute right; not a qualified right in the sense it isn&rsquo;t balanced with another right. &ldquo;Trumps all.&rdquo; + Venables and Thompson v. News Group Newspapers Ltd (2001) + Two youths found guilty in murder of a young boy. Question was if identifiable after release; court was asked to prevent injunction after they reach age of majority in order to protect right to life. Courts came down in favour of individuals; Art. 2 allowed courts to grant injunction preventing identification ever. + Maxine Carr v. News Group Newspapers Ltd (2004) + Involved with a murder case in that she gave a false alibi for her boyfriend. Was granted injunction to prevent her from being identified given she was being sent death threats.</p>

Hutchins (1977) + Tom Jones (Woodward) tried to stop a former agent from disclosing information about Jones&#8217; private life. + Hutchins&#8217; case was that Jones had put his life so far into the public domain was that it wouldn&rsquo;t be right for court to impose injunction. + Beckhams v. Nanny (2005) + Nanny wanted to publish about arguments between the Beckhams; court decided that she should be able to. + Public interest + Public domain + If the information is so widely circulated, it would be futile and ridiculous to impose an injunction to prevent it from being published. + Limitations: + Tony Blair v.

Court ruled injunction for the second edition of the paper, even though published in first. + Confidentiality / privacy + Limits of confidentiality: Kaye v.

Article 10 (Freedom of Expression) &mdash; balancing act. + Law was introduced within statute then developed through the common law.

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><h2>From last week + Reynolds Defence: Defence of responsible journalism on matters of real public interest. + Pg. 257 of Quinn + 10 step procedure + There *will* be something on the exam. + Some students have learned what all ten factors are. + Offer of amends + An honest mistake is made, publisher admits it and offers some way to amend situation. + Defence of innocent dissemination + Defendent was not the author, took reasonable care to prevent its publication and was not responsible for it. + Difference between general and special damages + General: can be proved to have resulted from the libel itself. General sum to represent losses. Up to ~£200,000 for individuals; lower for companies (they don’t have feeeeeelings.) ## Questions for next week: + What is a §39 order? + What case(s) in libel law prevents political parties from suing? + In relation to industry code, what are the rules in identifying location of a celebrity’s home? + Daniel Crane + Who is the deputy to the attorney general? + What are Chatham House rules? + What is the main case in the law of privacy? + What are Article 8 and Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights? # Two strands to Reynolds: ## Investigative reporting ### Reportage + What is the stance of the report? + Is it adopting the truth of the allegations or merely reporting the allegation had been made? + Tone/use of language? + Neuberger &mdash; qualified privilege must be without malice. I.e., if a parliamentarian breaks an injunction and reporting is done maliciously in order to defeat the purpose of the injunction, papers may be held in contempt. + Robert v. Gable (2006) + Two BNP members were accused of taking collections after a rally. + Reported in Searchlight. + Article didn’t take sides, and though there was no reflection of the response of individuals, did not matter as was information public was entitled to know (in addition to public interest) and the publication itself was neutral. ### Where problems can arise + Wrong photographs + Independently check photographs &mdash; just because it’s on Facebook doesn’t mean it’s real. + Reliance on tabloids + Not an answer to say “it’s been published elsewhere.” + Material outside the packaged report not matching the report + Graphics, the wall, underlay + Wallpaper — in generic images, make sure individuals are not identifiable. ### Libel law reform + CFAs, libel tourism, clamp on free speech ## Damages + General + Special + Nominal + A nominal amount is ordered: Grobolaw v. Express newspapers + Awarded £1 by House of Lords + Exemplary + Jury are asked to award a significant sum of money to set an example and send a message. + Aggravated ## Other remedies + Injunction + Court order preventing publication of material + Rule against prior restraint + Basic principle of libel law is that courts are very hesitant to award pre-publication injunctions. Defendants are expected to publish in good faith and deal with libel if it exists. + “The truth should out”. + It’s important for the information to come up, and if it’s wrong, for the subject to receive damages. The priority isn’t to prevent information from coming out. + Bonnard v. Perryman + Applicant has to show they’re right. + Much more likely to get an injunction for privacy and confidentiality + §12(3) HRA 1998 &mdash; If the court was considering some sort of relief, no such relief is to be granted before trial unless the applicant is able to show that they’re likely to win. + Lower test than Bonnard v. Perryman. + Greene v. ANL (2004) + Test had shifted from Bonnard v. Perryman due to HRA. + Ruled that Bonnard v. Perryman was still good law. + Statement in open court + If there is a settlement, claimant can ask for a statement in open court. + Claimant will set out nature of complaint, publisher will confirm what claimant says. + Rothschild v. Associated Newspapers Limited + Case last week &mdash; not necessarily important (based on facts) but good judgement of court judgement on libel case. ## Interface between libel and other areas of law + Court reporting / contempt of court + What does the report imply? + Statements at the end of the trial + Jury has just heard all the evidence that an individual has not been guilty, and then a paper publishes arguing that individual got off (and is in fact guilty), opens paper up to open and shut libel action. + Criminal law + Prisons, royal land, interception, police corruption, public servants, private investigation agencies + Privacy + Art 8 Human Rights Act 1998 + Naomi Campbell v. The Mirror + Murray v. Express Newspapers # Protecting a Journalist’s Sources + A reporter must protect confidential sources + Cardinal sin to break + PCC: Journalists have a moral obligation to keep promises of confidentiality + Why? + Ensures information comes into public domain + Protects whistleblowers + Last person to go to jain was in 1960s + Vassell Inquiry + Journalists should be prepared to go to prison rather than reveal their sources. + The Law + Art 10 European Convention on Human Rights + Freedom of expression and freedom to impart information + §10 Contempt of Court Act 1981 + No disclosure&hellip; “Unless it be established to the satisfaction of the court that disclosure is necessary in the interests of justice or national security or for the prevention of disorder or crime.” + Both about protecting private details and professional practice.</h2>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>For next class &mdash; Ch. 20 ## Libel, cont’d Quiz of the week: + What is the Reynolds Defence? What are the ten factors? + What is the offer of amends defence? An example of when it can be used? + What is the defence of innocent dissemination? + What is the difference between general damages and special damages? + What is the rule in Bonnard v. Perryman Defamation defences Justification + Burden of proof is on the broadcaster/publisher + How are you going to prove the truth? + What is the evidence you can rely on? + Assessing the evidence Fair Comment + An opinion + Based on true facts + Made honestly + “True test is whether the opinion is being made honestly by the person giving it.” + Bonnard v. Perryman + Has to be made without malice + Can also be considered as being published with recklessness. + Not very successful as a defence standing alone. + Berkoff v. Burchill (1996) + Latter wrote a review in Sunday Times. Said “From Hitchcock to Berkoff, directors are notoriously hideous-looking people.” Compared Berkoff to Frankenstein monster. + Times made application to strike case out; argued fair comments. + Both high court and court of appeal dismissed Times application. + Associated Newspapers v. Burstein (2007) + Playwright tried to sue about a play re: suicide bombers after reviewer said the play had anti-American undertones. + Playwright failed, judges argued writers of creative work necessarily expose themselves to criticism. + Dee V. Daily Telegraph (2008) + Player described as “World’s worst tennis player” after having lost a ton of matches. + Case was struck out; ruled that newspaper didn’t have to inconclusively prove he was the worst player in the world. + Spiller v. Joseph (2010) + Supreme Court said the defence should be referred to as “Honest Comment” instead of “Fair Comment”. Offer of Amends + Honest mistake + Defendant can claim a defence of Offer of Amends if they try to correct the mistake. + §2-4 defamation act of 1996. + Mistake must have been made without malice. + Essentially a guilty plea; usually involves a settlement. + Damages often reduced than if went to a full hearing. + Nail v. News Group Newspaper (2004) + Nail was given lesser damages because News Group had made a rejected offer of amends. Live Broadcasting + Innocent dissemination + Defamation Act 1996. + Defence applies if the broadcaster can show it did not control the person making the statement, they took reasonable care in the circumstances, and did not think anything it did contributed to the publication of the statement. + Applies to interviewees; not staff journalists. + If somebody says something untrue (or even swears live), host can step in and apologize on the spot. + If service is a mere conduit with no editorial oversight, then they are not responsible. + Problems: disincentivizes patrolling commenting channels + Law doesn’t protect responsible broadcasters Defence of Privilege + Defamation act 1996 &mdash; statutory privilege + When reporting courts, parliaments or councils, it’s subject to privilege set down in councils. + However, the Reynolds Defence (i.e., public interest) is a commonlaw approach. + Absolute Privilege + Contemporaneous fair and accurate court reports + If you’re being fair and accurate while reporting contemporaneously, you’re protected. + Qualified Privilege + Malice/explanation + Fair and accurate court reports + Reports of a legislature here and abroad + Public meetings + McCarten Turkington Breen v. Times Newspapers (2001) + Times claimed privilege because statement made in a press conference (public meeting). + Commonlaw Qualified Privilege + Establishes a defence where newspapers are able to report things in the public interest. + Reynolds v. Times Newspapers (1998) + Albert Reynolds had made statement and had been accused by Times of misleading the Irish parliament. Went to the House of Lords, Times’ case was that it was in the public interest to report what happened in a parliament and should not fear legal proceedings by politicians. Times lost on the facts, but new precedent was set. + Judges set down 10 point test: 1. Seriousness of allegation 2. Source of information 3. Steps taken by the journalists to verify information 4. Tone of article &mdash; making statements or requesting investigation? 5. Urgency of the matter 6. And on&hellip; + Grobellaar v. The Sun (2001) + Investigation in the Sun making allegation that a goalkeeper had taken money to not make saves. + Court of appeals said qualified privilege would not apply in that case. + Galloway v. The Telegraph + Telegraph documents had suggested that Galloway had been in collusion with the Iraqi foreign embassy and had acted improperly. Galloway was named in documents. + Report wasn’t objective enough; wasn’t level-headed enough in its reporting. + Exception: GKR Karate v. Yorkshire Post (2000) + Newspaper argued GKR was selling dodgy karate lessons + Court ruled that it was in the public interest to bring report to public, even though it was found GKR was in the right. + Jameel v. Wall St Journal (2007) + Resurrected Reynolds + WSJ level-headedly and evenly reported about a bank and its potential links with terrorists. + Journalism should be allowed to flourish and there should be protection for investigative journalism within the law. + Test less set in stone than pointers. + Protects reports in the public interest, not celebrity gossip. + If reporting on a matter of public interest in a level-headed, responsible manner, you may have a defence even if you get it wrong.</p>
