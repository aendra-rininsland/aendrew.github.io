  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><h3>Disclaimer: this may have changed in more recent versions of BuddyPress, so your mileage may very substantially. Please let me know if something&rsquo;s not working, but caveat lector none of this comes with any warranty or support whatsoever.</h3>

<p>A bit over a year ago, I <a href="http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/4948/importing-users-to-buddypress-with-custom-fields">asked a question</a> on the <a href="http://wordpress.stackexchange.com">WordPress Stack Exchange site</a> about importing content from a proprietary database into <a href="http://www.buddypress.org">BuddyPress</a>, the &ldquo;social network in a box&rdquo; plugin for <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a>. Not getting anything resembling a response, I ended up writing a whole schwack of MySQL statements. After answering my question on SO, I&rsquo;ve averaged about an email every 4-6 months about how I managed to do what I did. Alas, I was a total jerk and couldn&rsquo;t find the SQL I use and ended up ignoring most of them.</p>

<p><strong>Until today!</strong></p>

<p>Note that the following is <strong>not</strong> a one-click script that will import your users. It&rsquo;s a starting point I&rsquo;m posting in hopes that somebody finds it useful. You <strong>will</strong> need to modify it for your purposes, and <em>please, please, <strong>PLEASE</strong></em> don&rsquo;t use this on a production database, and make backups frequently. I take no responsibility if you screw something up with it!</p>

<p>Also attached to this post is an importer script <a href="http://www.dimunation.com">Michael Dimunation</a> sent me awhile back after I emailed him the SQL query in question. I have no idea what it does and have never used it &mdash; again, same caveats apply, but hopefully somebody finds it useful.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><h2>For exam</h2>

<ul>
<li>30 multi-choice questions;</li>
<li>Know the names and intent of provisions; know case names.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Important cases</h2>

<ul>
<li>Flood v. Times Newspapers Ltd. (2011) &mdash; Supreme Court

<ul>
<li>Upholds and restates the Reynolds Defence.</li>
<li>Article allegations that a British security company with wealthy Russian clients paid for sensitive information about extraditions</li>
<li>Subject to a libel complaint from police officer named. Flood was exonerated, so was pressing for libel.</li>
<li>Judges came down on side of the Times; argued it was in the public interest for story to be published.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Story told was high public interest&rdquo; &mdash; argued if Flood were not named, other members of the extradition unit would come under public scrutiny.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h1>Copyright Law</h1>

<ul>
<li>Purpose

<ul>
<li>Designed to ensure those who create copyright works — photographs, film footage, books, etc. — are rewarded for their labours.</li>
<li>Incentivizes creative work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tangible form

<ul>
<li>No copyright in ideas — has to be created before it gets copyright.</li>
<li>No copyright in facts</li>
<li>Hughie Green v. NZ Broadcasting (1989) — elements of original programming in a knockoff in New Zealand. &ldquo;Nobody owns the rights to a talent contest.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Norowozian v. Arks (1999) — A Guinness advert using a technique (&ldquo;jump cutting&rdquo;) and dance style was similar to that used in the plaintiff&rsquo;s film. Court ruled nobody owns a dance style or film technique.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Physical ownership v copyright

<ul>
<li>Approached as a property right (Specifically intellectual property)</li>
<li>If you receive a letter, copyright rests with the letter writer — not the receiver.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Copyrights in a news report</li>
<li>No need for a registration

<ul>
<li>You don&rsquo;t have to register work to have a copyright on something. No &ldquo;copyright register&rdquo;. Work automatically gains protection, even without the ©</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Breach — substantial use

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;What is worth copying is worth protecting&rdquo; — principle</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Who owns it?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Author &mdash; if you&rsquo;re independent, then you own the copyright.</li>
<li>Employees &mdash; if you&rsquo;re employed by someone, then it&rsquo;s your employer who owns the copyright.</li>
<li>Freelancers &mdash; you generally own the copyright; newspapers now generally have a provision allowing reproduction of a piece bought from a freelancer online, etc.

<ul>
<li>Robin Ray v. Classic FM (1998) &mdash; asked to create an internal system for classifying music work. Radio station then tried to sell system to others; court ruled Classic FM wasn&rsquo;t allowed to sell Ray&rsquo;s work without permission.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Assignment &mdash; Who owns the copyright?</li>
<li>License &mdash; What is the breadth of the license? Single use, only on TV, on the Internet, both? For a time length or Into perpetuity? Where is this usage allowed?</li>
</ul>


<h2>Length of copyright</h2>

<ul>
<li>Creative works: 70 years from end of year author died</li>
<li>If author unknown, 70 years from end of year of publication</li>
<li>Sound recordings / broadcast: 50 years from end of year of first publication

<ul>
<li> If it involves, say, a song with lyrics, the lyrics will be copyrighted as per the above (I.e., 70 years).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Legal events</h2>

<ul>
<li>§30 CopyrighT Designs and Patents Act 1988

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Fair dealing&rdquo; provision places reporting current events about the interest of a copyright owner.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Fair dealing with a work other than a photograph for the purpose of reporting events does not infringe any copyright in the work, so long as it is accompanied by a sufficient acknowledgment.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is fair?

<ul>
<li>Simply lifting content isn&rsquo;t fair; not giving a credit isn&rsquo;t fair.</li>
<li>Using material as wallpaper isn&rsquo;t fair.</li>
<li>Time Warner Co V. Channel Four Television (1994)

<ul>
<li>Over 80% of Clockwork Orange was shown in a programme on Channel 4; court ruled in favour of Channel 4 despite lack of permission.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pro Seiben v. Carlton UK TV (1999)

<ul>
<li>Carlton UK TV was doing programme on chequebook journalism and used clip from Pro Seiben exclusive; ruled on side of Carlton.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Exclusivity

<ul>
<li>Less likely to be fair is just used to &ldquo;yank rug out&rdquo; from under a competitor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Motive</li>
<li>Informational</li>
<li>Restrictions</li>
<li>Credit</li>
<li>Does not apply to stills.</li>
<li>Fair dealing for criticism, review</li>
<li>Public interest defence?

<ul>
<li>Paddy Ashdown v. Telegraph — Telegraph had published snippet from plaintiff&rsquo;s unpublished autobiography; court ruled there was a public interest due to it soon coming out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Damages — market rate/aggravated

<ul>
<li>Paid in terms of market rate; more in aggravated circumstances (photo stolen)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Release forms — important; allows you to use their footage forevermore.</li>
<li>Sports footage — if showing footage, normally able to use 60 seconds with credit. If a series of matches (I.e., World Cup or something), increases to 90 seconds.</li>
<li>Internet — copyright applies as much as anywhere else. If using someone else&rsquo;s photo, you have to seek permission.</li>
<li>§ 58 Copyright and Design Act

<ul>
<li>If someone giving a speech, you&rsquo;re generally allowed to report it without permission.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><h3>From last week:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Section 4(2) &mdash; postponement order. Allows postpone publication of proceedings. Not forever. For avoiding a substantial risk of prejudice in administrating justice.</li>
<li>Section 39 &mdash; Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Wide-ranging order allowing courts to grant order preventing identification of anyone 17 or under involved in court proceedings, either criminal or civil.</li>
<li>Section 11 order &mdash; Allows court to withhold name of individual from public. I.e., in a blackmail case.</li>
<li>Common law and statutory qualified privilege &mdash; two different types of defences:

<ol>
<li> Defamation act (statutory) &mdash; public forums fairly and accurately reported are protected under qualified privilege.</li>
<li> Common law privilege &mdash; derived from judge-made law. Reynolds Defence. A matter of public interest, which has been reported responsibly, can be defended as such.
+Article 2 &mdash; Right to Life. If someone’s life is at stake due to reporting, injunction can be put up against identification</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If an injunction is being sought against a matter that touches upon a matter relating to freedom of speech, newspaper must be contacted and judge shouldn’t granted unless it felt applicant is going to win.</li>
<li>Rules on reporting in the youth court: reporters allowed, public is not. S49 of Children and Young Persons Act 1933 states that anyone 17 and below shouldn’t be identified (automatic ban).</li>
</ul>


<h2>Privacy</h2>

<h3>Other privacy legal issues</h3>

<ul>
<li>Data Protection Act 1998

<ul>

<li>Court shouldn’t grant injunctions prior to publication over individual data held</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Industry regulations surrounding privacy</h3>

<ul>
<li>PCC Code / Ofcom Broadcasting Code</li>
<li>Provision that individual’s privacy should not be breached a very important part of codes.</li>
<li>Privacy should not be breached unless it’s in the public interest

<ul>
<li>Not simply what’s interesting to the public.</li>
<li>Focused on public health/safety; prevent public from being misled; protect national security; something the public should know about</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Specific issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>Proportionality: is the breach that’s taking place proportionate to the wrongdoing being exposed?

<ul>
<li>Secret filming: can’t be a fishing expedition; needs to have prima facie evidence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Public figures: politicians and others who have spent their life putting it into the public domain, less right than average person.</li>
<li>Public domain: Similar to the above?</li>
<li>Methodology: act respectfully and responsibly; put yourself in the position of who you’re filming.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Areas of privacy:</p>

<ul>
<li>People in distress

<ul>
<li>Each individual case on its own merit; getting a sense of what’s going on is okay, but tight focus on person’s face is not.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Intimate details</li>
<li>Health matters

<ul>
<li>Going into individual’s condition (esp. pregnancy before 12 weeks) on wrong side.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Revisiting past events</li>
<li>Children — heightened regulation to protect children, shouldn’t be questioned about private matters except in loco parentis</li>
<li>Door-stepping — Justified in on-the-day stories of public interest. Not normally for investigative reporting unless individual contacted beforehand and asked for a response. If response not given, might be justified to door-step.</li>
<li>Suicide — number of regulations to respect families and prevent copycats. Not allowed to be very in-depth. Photo of individual about to jump from bridge or window not allowed.

<ul>
<li>Daily Sport “suicide hotspots” story &mdash; PCC ruled unacceptable, gave too much detail and encouraged copycats.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Locations

<ul>
<li>Key test: “A reasonable expectation of privacy”

<ul>
<li>Can be even in a public place</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Churches

<ul>
<li>Paul McCartney praying after death of wife; Hallo in 1998. PCC ruled on McCartney’s side.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Beaches

<ul>
<li>Daily Mail article in 2000 about Anna Ford on public beach in swimwear.</li>
<li>PCC ruled on side of news media; Ford appealed, ruling upheld.</li>
<li>Anna Macpherson with children &mdash; unacceptable (esp. because on private beach)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An address of a celebrity

<ul>
<li>Not acceptable to identify location of individual’s house.

<ul>
<li>Daniel Craigg and Miz Dynamite made complaints; deemed to be on wrong side of the line.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Funerals

<ul>
<li>Carol Smiley at mother’s funeral — deemed unacceptable to film</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Filming with police

<ul>
<li>No right to film in private house with police</li>
<li>Filming arrest or police operation, would have to pixelate individuals arrested.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Methodology for gaining private information

<ul>
<li>Filming in public places

<ul>
<li>If visible to naked eye in a public place, it’s probably acceptable.

<ul>
<li>Careful: shopping centres; royal parks; buses open to public but not public places.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Long range lenses: care must be used.

<ul>
<li>2002 &mdash; Julie Goodyear complained about photographs of her sitting in back garden via long lens. Considered breach, wouldn’t have been visible without lens and not in public interest.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Secret filming

<ul>
<li>Forms normally have to be filled out justifying filming.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Harassment

<ul>
<li>Not allowed!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Confidentiality/Privacy</h1>

<h2>Major cases</h2>

<ul>
<li>Douglas v. Hallo (2000)

<ul>
<li>Wedding between Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas. Had sold rights to Ok magazine; rival Hallo had photographer who surreptitiously took photos as part of wedding party. Douglases sued for breach of confidence; court upheld the right of the Douglases to protect their wedding. Court argued law of privacy would uphold law of confidentiality; duty of confidentiality didn&rsquo;t need to be identified. Setting was private, info had a commercial value &mdash; injunction would be granted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Theakston v. MGN Ltd (2002): photographs

<ul>
<li>TV star visited brothel; story was told about exploits. Injunction sought, not granted about an account of what happened, though injunction granted against photographs being published.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Photographs can be particularly intrusive, particularly if not done with consent.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Peck v. UK (2003): privacy in a public place

<ul>
<li>Person tried to commit suicide, picture being prevented given to media, ECHR came down on his side and the council had acted inappropriately in providing photos to media.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Princess Caroline von Hannover v. Germany (2004)

<ul>
<li>Argued pictures taken of her were not of public interest and she was being harassed. ECHR came down on Princess Caroline von Hannover&rsquo;s side.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Naomi Campbell v. MGN Ltd (2004) (<strong>the</strong> major case re: privacy)

<ul>
<li>Campbell sued over report in Daily Mirror talking about her treatments for drug addiction. Report showed a photo of her leaving therapy session and gave details about therapy; frequency of therapy. Went to House of Lords, which came down 3-2 in favour of Campbell saying it was acceptable to publish details of drug treatment and to say she had a drug problem, but not acceptable to say she was going to Narcotics Anonymous, or where the treatment, or the kind of treatment; also, unacceptable to show photos of her leaving Narcotics Anonymous. Termed &ldquo;Wrongful disclosure of private information&rdquo;. Looks at the following:

<ol type="a">
<li> Is it private information?</li>
<li> If disclosure took place, would it cause substantial offence to a reasonable person?</li>
<li> What are the benefits of disclosure?</li>
<li> Where does the public interest lie?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Lady Justice Hale: distinction being made between coming out from treatment or going about their normal business.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>McKennitt v. Ash (2005)

<ul>
<li>Brought privacy to another level; a Canadian singer (Lorraine McKennitt) had book written about her by friend. Discussed things only a friend would be aware of.</li>
<li>Court sided with McKennitt; argued she was entitled to protect this information and friend didn&rsquo;t have right to publish it. In judgement itself, not made clear what was true or not; court said it wasn&rsquo;t for the claimant to sift through information to discriminate against what is true or not as that would undermine privacy further.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Murray v. Big Pictures (2008)

<ul>
<li>JK Rowling followed around Edinburgh with child in a pram; injunction sought to prevent photographs to pursue her.</li>
<li>Court granted, arguing special protection granted to children.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Max Mosley v. News Group Newspapers Ltd (2008)

<ul>
<li>Sued over NOTW articles suggesting he had been involved in Nazi-themed sex parties.</li>
<li>Judge came down arguing on the facts that there wasn&rsquo;t evidence the party was Nazi themed. If it was, there would be public interest.</li>
<li>Mosley then argued to the ECHR he should be aware of articles coming out about him, but ECHR argued he didn&rsquo;t have a right to be able to step in an attempt to stop publication. No right for claimant to be told about matter relating to privacy prior to publication.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>LNS v. Persons Unknown (2010)

<ul>
<li>Footballer (John Terry) tried to create a blanket injunction about an affair. Came down against Terry, arguing he was doing this only to protect commercial interests.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Super injunctions

<ul>
<li>Trafigura v. Guardian Newspapers

<ul>
<li>Guardian had info re: Trafigura&rsquo;s toxic waste. Court imposed injunction on publication, but also on publication of information about injunction.</li>
<li>MP argued there shouldn&rsquo;t be a superinjunction; injunction unraveled and information because public.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ferdinand v. MGN Ltd (2011)

<ul>
<li>Rio brought a case against Mirror; Mirror had published details about an affair. Judge Nichol came down on side of newspaper.

<ul>
<li>Ferdinand was the head of English football team; had tried to establish reputation as a reformed character (even having written an autobiography); lady had a right to tell story.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Spelman v. Express Newspapers Ltd

<ul>
<li>Newspaper got paper about rugby player (son of MP) had been ordering illegal performance enhancing drugs. Injunction initially granted then revoked; argued info was in the public domain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Princess Caroline von Hannover (2012)</p>

<ul>
<li>Case showed her and her family walking through the streets of Monaco with father, Prince Rainier, who had been ill. Law came down on side of press, arguing showing a reigning monarch in recovery was in the public interest.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Human Rights Act §12(3)</p>

<ul>
<li>No injunction should be granted unless applicant is likely to win its case.</li>
<li>Media has to be given notice of applicantions</li>
<li>Much lower test than in libel (I.e., Bonnard v. Perryman), where it would be granted only if applicant is able to establish the falsity of the claims.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h1>The Right to Life</h1>

<ul>
<li>Article 2 &mdash; Everyone&rsquo;s right to life should be protected by law. Everyone&rsquo;s life should be protected by the law, except in the case of capital punishment.

<ul>
<li>An absolute right; not a qualified right in the sense it isn&rsquo;t balanced with another right. &ldquo;Trumps all.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Venables and Thompson v. News Group Newspapers Ltd (2001)

<ul>
<li>Two youths found guilty in murder of a young boy. Question was if identifiable after release; court was asked to prevent injunction after they reach age of majority in order to protect right to life. Courts came down in favour of individuals; Art. 2 allowed courts to grant injunction preventing identification ever.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Maxine Carr v. News Group Newspapers Ltd (2004)

<ul>
<li>Involved with a murder case in that she gave a false alibi for her boyfriend. Was granted injunction to prevent her from being identified given she was being sent death threats.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Answers from last week:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the watershed?

<ul>
<li>9 p.m. to 5 a.m., more adult content is allowed. Not allowed outside of that span in order to protect young persons.</li>
<li>Doesn&rsquo;t change instantly; more adult the later in the evening.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Issues on payments to criminals?

<ul>
<li>Journalists should not be making payments to criminals unless there is a clear public interest. (PCC and Ofcom.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Police Bail

<ul>
<li>The outcome of an individual being taken to the police station is threefold: release without charge, held on charge, or released on police bail.</li>
<li>I.e., the police are still making enquiries and may call you back.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&ldquo;Without prejudice communication&rdquo; &mdash; Open conversation between lawyers, but does not effect the outcome of a case.</li>
<li>Spycatcher principle &mdash; if an injunction or court order applies to one paper, it applies to all of them.</li>
</ul>


<p>Next week:
+ What are the rules of the PCC about journalists seeking interviews at hospitals?
+ In Copyright Law, what is the difference between an assignment and a copyright license?
+ Name three ways journalists can be subject to the criminal law in finding information.
+ If appealing from the magistrate&rsquo;s court on a point of law and a point of fact, where does the appeal go?
+ What court does a Lord Justice sit in?
+ How does the PCC define the public interest?
+ Are there any rules concerning reporting celebrities becoming pregnant?</p>

<p>This week&rsquo;s media law issues:
1. Search &ldquo;secret courts&rdquo; &mdash; ongoing issue in legislation re: new rules brought in by MoJ making some courts easier to be heard in closed session.
1. Case in ECHR &mdash; Tussalp v. Turkey &mdash; two defamation actions against PM against journalist. Court came down on side of journalist: &ldquo;Turkish courts had not set the remarks within a proper context and the form in which they were conveyed.&rdquo; Rules remarks were lawful. &ldquo;Turkish courts had failed to establish any pressing need for establishing PM&rsquo;s rights above freedom of expression.&rdquo;</p>

<h1>Privacy</h1>

<h2>Cases</h2>

<ul>
<li>Personal relationships

<ul>
<li>Stephens v Avery</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Confidential information

<ul>
<li>Creation Records v News Group Newspapers (1997)

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Employment relationships

<ul>
<li>An employee owes a duty of confidentiality to employer.</li>
<li>An employer is entitled to rely on an employee remaining confidential.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Brisco v. Brisco</li>
<li>Nightjack case &mdash; court ruled it was in the public interest in blogger&rsquo;s identity (in this case, a night police officer) to be disclosed.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Defences</h1>

<ul>
<li>Iniquity

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Something which is immoral, unrighteous, etc.&rdquo;</li>
<li>If there is information that is confidential but exposes wrongdoing, may be used as a defence.</li>
<li>Lions Laboratories v. Evans

<ul>
<li>Story arguing breathalyzer ineffective via documents from former employee.</li>
<li>Lion Laboratories argued employee took information they wouldn&rsquo;t have access to; should be considered confidential and not published.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cook v. McVicker (1984)

<ul>
<li>Reporter surreptitiously recorded off-the-record conversation about police corruption; reporter decided to publish and with attribution.</li>
<li>Reporter successfully argued it would be in the public interest to reveal such information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Viagogo v. Channel 4 (2012)

<ul>
<li>Investigative report re: online ticketing. Sought injunction to prevent airing of report. Confidentiality agreement signed at Viagogo, argued information obtained unlawfully.</li>
<li>Clear public interest in correcting the false image Viagogo put forward. &ldquo;Balancing exercise favoured the defendant.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Person has courted publicity

<ul>
<li> Woodward v. Hutchins (1977)

<ul>
<li> Tom Jones (Woodward) tried to stop a former agent from disclosing information about Jones&#8217; private life.</li>
<li> Hutchins&#8217; case was that Jones had put his life so far into the public domain was that it wouldn&rsquo;t be right for court to impose injunction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Beckhams v. Nanny (2005)

<ul>
<li> Nanny wanted to publish about arguments between the Beckhams; court decided that she should be able to.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Public interest</li>
<li>Public domain

<ul>
<li>If the information is so widely circulated, it would be futile and ridiculous to impose an injunction to prevent it from being published.

<ul>
<li>Limitations:

<ul>
<li>Tony Blair v. Mail on Sunday &mdash; Nanny wanted to publish re: Blairs&#8217; home life. Court ruled injunction for the second edition of the paper, even though published in first.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Confidentiality / privacy

<ul>
<li> Limits of confidentiality: Kaye v. Robertson (1991)

<ul>
<li>If no duty of confidentiality, argument doesn&rsquo;t work.</li>
<li>In 1991, an actor (Kaye) was driving when scaffolding collapsed, injuring him. Taken to hospital and suffering extensive surgery.</li>
<li>While there, reporters from Sunday Sport went into his room, photographed him and interviewed him. Went to Court of Appeal; confidential setting; court focused on relationship between Kaye and photographer.</li>
<li>No duty owed between Kaye and the photographer. No law of privacy and the law of confidentiality different.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Human Rights Act (1998) Art. 8 sets out privacy as a human right; creates a law of privacy.

<ul>
<li>Article 8 v. Article 10 (Freedom of Expression) &mdash; balancing act.</li>
<li>Law was introduced within statute then developed through the common law. Judges allowed to develop the law at will; politicians really should have created an Act outlining everything.</li>
<li>§12 and injunctions &mdash; if the person against whom an injunction is directed is not in court, court should not grant injunction.</li>
<li>No relief should be granted before publishing unless it can be established claimant is highly likely to establish facts are wrong afterwards.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Photographs &mdash; greater impact/protection</li>
<li>Privacy in a public place &mdash; media entitled to film in a public place.

<ul>
<li>Peck case &mdash; Man with knife about to commit suicide but apprehended was filmed; British court argued he was in a public place, ECHR said authorities had not upheld his privacy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reasonable expectation of privacy

<ul>
<li>Depends on circumstances, but parameters have been extended significantly over time.</li>
<li>In restaurant, in someone else&rsquo;s house, etc. reasonable expectation of privacy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Children

<ul>
<li>Not allowed to be filmed; JK Rowling got injunction against anyone filming her children.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Cases often determined on the facts.

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Intense focus&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Protecting a Journalist’s Sources</h1>

<ul>
<li>Industry Codes</li>
<li>Practical considerations</li>
<li>Main themes

<ul>
<li>Domestic law v. Europe

<ul>
<li>Not a lot of protection under §10; other interests put above those of journalists.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>X v Morgan Grampian 1990

<ul>
<li>Leaker gave documents to Morgan Grampian. House of Lords didn’t agree, fined Goodwin £5,000 for Contempt of Court when he wouldn’t give it up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Goodwin v UK 1996</p>

<ul>
<li>Goodwin took to European Court of Human Rights. Came down on his side, argued the order was not appropriate and should not have order him to give up source.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The Law</p>

<ul>
<li>Art 10 European Convention on Human Rights

<ul>
<li>Freedom of expression and freedom to impart information</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>§10 Contempt of Court Act 1981

<ul>
<li>No disclosure&hellip; “Unless it be established to the satisfaction of the court that disclosure <strong><em>is necessary in the interests of justice or national security or for the prevention of disorder or crime.</em></strong>”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Prevention of crime</p>

<ul>
<li>Re: An Inquiry under the Company Securities Act 1985

<ul>
<li>Journalist for Independent had info; Monopolies Commissioner requested source to pursue insider trading charges.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>“Prevention of the crime should be looked at in the broader sense.”</li>
<li>Independent refused to disclosure source, paid £20,000</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>National security

<ul>
<li>Sec of State for Defence v Guardian (1985)</li>
<li>Also known as the Tisdall Affair</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Interests of Justice

<ul>
<li>Camelot Group v Centaur Communications Ltd (1999)

<ul>
<li>Article had disclosed directors had received payrise, while money for charities had not risen substantially. Court argued there was a public interest in disclosure, “there’s a risk that an employee proven untrustworthy in one respect might be untrustworthy in another.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Elton John v Express Newspapers (2000)

<ul>
<li>Elton John wanted to know who had disclosed material from a bin in his room.</li>
<li>Inquiry wasn’t necessary; could be identified outside the court. Sir Elton hadn’t taken the lengths outside the court.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ashworth Hospital v MGN Ltd (2002)

<ul>
<li>Hospital wanted the source; Ackroyd said it was she mid-way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Merseyside NHS Trust v Robin Ackroyd (2006)

<ul>
<li>Hospital then went after Ackroyd, court ruled in her favour.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><h2>From last week</h2>

<ul>
<li>Reynolds Defence: Defence of responsible journalism on matters of real public interest.

<ul>
<li>Pg. 257 of Quinn

<ul>
<li>10 step procedure</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There <em>will</em> be something on the exam.

<ul>
<li>Some students have learned what all ten factors are.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Offer of amends

<ul>
<li>An honest mistake is made, publisher admits it and offers some way to amend situation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Defence of innocent dissemination

<ul>
<li>Defendent was not the author, took reasonable care to prevent its publication and was not responsible for it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Difference between general and special damages

<ul>
<li>General: can be proved to have resulted from the libel itself. General sum to represent losses. Up to ~£200,000 for individuals; lower for companies (they don’t have feeeeeelings.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Questions for next week:</h2>

<ul>
<li>What is a §39 order?</li>
<li>What case(s) in libel law prevents political parties from suing?</li>
<li>In relation to industry code, what are the rules in identifying location of a celebrity’s home?

<ul>
<li>Daniel Crane</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Who is the deputy to the attorney general?</li>
<li>What are Chatham House rules?</li>
<li>What is the main case in the law of privacy?</li>
<li>What are Article 8 and Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights?</li>
</ul>


<h1>Two strands to Reynolds:</h1>

<h2>Investigative reporting</h2>

<h3>Reportage</h3>

<ul>
<li>What is the stance of the report?</li>
<li>Is it adopting the truth of the allegations or merely reporting the allegation had been made?</li>
<li>Tone/use of language?</li>
<li>Neuberger &mdash; qualified privilege must be without malice. I.e., if a parliamentarian breaks an injunction and reporting is done maliciously in order to defeat the purpose of the injunction, papers may be held in contempt.</li>
<li>Robert v. Gable (2006)

<ul>
<li>Two BNP members were accused of taking collections after a rally.</li>
<li>Reported in Searchlight.</li>
<li>Article didn’t take sides, and though there was no reflection of the response of individuals, did not matter as was information public was entitled to know (in addition to public interest) and the publication itself was neutral.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Where problems can arise</h3>

<ul>
<li>Wrong photographs

<ul>
<li>Independently check photographs &mdash; just because it’s on Facebook doesn’t mean it’s real.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reliance on tabloids

<ul>
<li>Not an answer to say “it’s been published elsewhere.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Material outside the packaged report not matching the report

<ul>
<li>Graphics, the wall, underlay</li>
<li>Wallpaper — in generic images, make sure individuals are not identifiable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Libel law reform</h3>

<ul>
<li>CFAs, libel tourism, clamp on free speech</li>
</ul>


<h2>Damages</h2>

<ul>
<li>General</li>
<li>Special</li>
<li>Nominal

<ul>
<li>A nominal amount is ordered: Grobolaw v. Express newspapers

<ul>
<li>Awarded £1 by House of Lords</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Exemplary

<ul>
<li>Jury are asked to award a significant sum of money to set an example and send a message.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Aggravated</li>
</ul>


<h2>Other remedies</h2>

<ul>
<li>Injunction

<ul>
<li>Court order preventing publication of material</li>
<li>Rule against prior restraint</li>
<li>Basic principle of libel law is that courts are very hesitant to award pre-publication injunctions. Defendants are expected to publish in good faith and deal with libel if it exists.

<ul>
<li>“The truth should out”.

<ul>
<li>It’s important for the information to come up, and if it’s wrong, for the subject to receive damages. The priority isn’t to prevent information from coming out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bonnard v. Perryman

<ul>
<li>Applicant has to show they’re right.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Much more likely to get an injunction for privacy and confidentiality</li>
<li>§12(3) HRA 1998 &mdash; If the court was considering some sort of relief, no such relief is to be granted before trial unless the applicant is able to show that they’re likely to win.

<ul>
<li>Lower test than Bonnard v. Perryman.</li>
<li>Greene v. ANL (2004)

<ul>
<li>Test had shifted from Bonnard v. Perryman due to HRA.</li>
<li>Ruled that Bonnard v. Perryman was still good law.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Statement in open court

<ul>
<li>If there is a settlement, claimant can ask for a statement in open court.</li>
<li>Claimant will set out nature of complaint, publisher will confirm what claimant says.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rothschild v. Associated Newspapers Limited

<ul>
<li>Case last week &mdash; not necessarily important (based on facts) but good judgement of court judgement on libel case.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Interface between libel and other areas of law</h2>

<ul>
<li>Court reporting / contempt of court

<ul>
<li>What does the report imply?</li>
<li>Statements at the end of the trial

<ul>
<li>Jury has just heard all the evidence that an individual has not been guilty, and then a paper publishes arguing that individual got off (and is in fact guilty), opens paper up to open and shut libel action.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Criminal law

<ul>
<li>Prisons, royal land, interception, police corruption, public servants, private investigation agencies</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Privacy

<ul>
<li>Art 8 Human Rights Act 1998</li>
<li>Naomi Campbell v. The Mirror</li>
<li>Murray v. Express Newspapers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h1>Protecting a Journalist’s Sources</h1>

<ul>
<li>A reporter must protect confidential sources

<ul>
<li>Cardinal sin to break</li>
<li>PCC: Journalists have a moral obligation to keep promises of confidentiality</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why?

<ul>
<li>Ensures information comes into public domain</li>
<li>Protects whistleblowers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Last person to go to jain was in 1960s

<ul>
<li>Vassell Inquiry</li>
<li>Journalists should be prepared to go to prison rather than reveal their sources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Law

<ul>
<li>Art 10 European Convention on Human Rights

<ul>
<li> Freedom of expression and freedom to impart information</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>§10 Contempt of Court Act 1981

<ul>
<li>No disclosure&hellip; “Unless it be established to the satisfaction of the court that disclosure is necessary in the interests of justice or national security or for the prevention of disorder or crime.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Both about protecting private details and professional practice.</li>
</ul>
