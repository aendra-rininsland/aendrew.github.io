  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Well, where to begin? I’ve been in London almost two days now, having arrived at around 2:00 p.m. on the 15th. My flight was fantastic — never before have I gotten an extra seat to myself on a transcontinental flight — and I was able to get enough sleep to not be totally comatose the first afternoon. Quite a good thing, that; lugging the entirety of your accumulated worldly possessions (in the form of two 50-pound suitcases) through the heart of London is not a task for the faint of heart. Initially I was going to take the Piccadilly Line somewhere, transfer to the Jubilee Line, and then get off at my destination station. Instead, with Jubilee Line closed south of Baker Street Station, I had to transfer to another line and then on to Jubilee, finally arriving at my terminating station at around 5:15 p.m. Even Baker Street was closed for a few minutes, throwing me into quite a state of confusion, given Baker Street was where I was told to go at the first closed station. A few minutes and some frantic pacing later, however, the Jubilee Line opened and I was on my way. I have fairly mixed feelings about the hostel I’m staying at — on one hand, the area around it is fairly nice and there a quite a few really decent pubs within walking distance. Food and whatnot seems a bit cheaper in Brent than it does in Islington, and there’s a ton of interesting foreign food close to Kilburn Station. One of the interesting places is the Westbury, where I spent a bunch of time last night (more on that later). Other than that, the hostel’s pretty unremarkable. I’m in the first room by the entrance, which means there’s a constant flux of noise coming from the heavily-hinged doors slamming after people enter (not to mention the assholes who decided it’d be a great idea to have a long, loud conversation outside my door at 7 a.m. today). Combining that with semi-functional Internet, in addition to the fact it’s about 45 minutes from where I’m studying, means I’ll probably try to find somewhere else once my stay ends this coming Wednesday. Hostel griping aside, I’m having a pretty decent time so far. On my first night, I went to a pub and used their free wifi to do some work and send some emails, can’t remember the name at the moment but will update this post once I do (It’s one door down from the Westbury, at any rate). Quite a nice pub, with decent prices and friendly staff. Last night, however, I decided I wanted to listen to some live music before school starts and I’m too busy to do anything interesting. While I initially planned on checking out the legendary Fabric, I figured going to an after-hours club a 45-minute night bus away from where I’m staying was a bad idea, what with real estate appointments at 11 in the morning. As such, I started to look for places within walking distance. One of such places was the Westbury, what seems like an old pub turned into a pretty trendy club. Not much for beer — the bottled fair is limited to a fairly mediocre selection of import beers that includes Sol, Heineken and a few others. Moreover, it’s certainly a place to drink cocktails — while I limited myself to Gin and Tonics, it seemed like they make a decent Mojito, with lots of mint leaves. Divided into a main area with a dance floor and a quieter antechamber containing another smaller bar, the place was moderately busy when I arrived around 10:30 and was packed when I left around 1:30. Although I was really hoping for some drum’n’bass or dubstep, the DJs were decidedly competent and had the crowd moving the entire time with a combination of hip-hop and r&amp;b, with the occasional foray into house. It was certainly bustling, with a nice mixture of people. A single Gin and Tonic set me back £4.30, with the bottled beer somewhere around £3.90; from my reading, that’s pretty typical pricing for the London club scene. Anyhoo, more later. -æ.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Something I&rsquo;ve always done at each major turning point in my life is to write a very long, detailed thank-you note. I wrote this initially upon arriving in the UK and sat on it for the entire first semester, trying to make sure I remembered everyone I should mention. Now that it&rsquo;s the start of 2012, and with no more additions to this list, I figure now&rsquo;s a good time to finally finish and post it. Without further ado: First of all, thank you to my amazing and wonderful girlfriend Siyuan, without whom I would never have thought I&rsquo;m capable of doing what I&rsquo;m about to do. In addition to being my guiding light in terms of moving to the UK, she was also the driving force behind my quitting smoking, and is the love of my life. Babe, you&rsquo;re awesome. Secondly and somewhat obviously, thank you to my parents, who&rsquo;ve put up with all my idiosyncrasies and bad behaviour this last half decade. Thank you for understanding why I do what I do, and for all the help moving. Thanks also to my sister, who has sat through more political discussions between my parents and I than any sibling should have to endure, and who spent her only week of vacation this summer moving my disorganized self out of the crater where I used to live. Thanks to the friends I hang around most — you know who you are. In no particular order: Special thanks to Brad Halasz for being the longest-running of all my roommates (and for picking up your stuff; New Brad&rsquo;s cool too.); also, thanks for letting me crash on your couch for something like a month straight a few summers ago, and for getting passes to all those things for Hotbox, for all the crazy parties, Shambhalas and Motion Notions. Keep on Shponglin&#8217;. Special thanks also to Ben Hoffman for being the chaotic-good force of nature that he is, for always being down with even my most ridiculous ideas, for totally destroying it with the loads to the dump during my move-out; also for still being the coolest person I&rsquo;ve ever met at the Gauntlet. Another special thanks to Jon Roe, for sharing a similarly-awful sense of humour all those years ago editing Spoof 2006 at the Gauntlet, for being the singly-most laid-back person I&rsquo;ve ever met and for just being a pretty awesome all-around dude. Also, thanks for taking over the duties of party house post-graduation; I was feeling fairly antisocial there for awhile&hellip; Also, your roommates are awesome. Thanks to Christian Louden for being an awesome roommate and friend; thanks also to Aldo Aguirre &mdash; I didn&rsquo;t get to know you that well, but you&rsquo;re in the uppermost bracket in terms of cool roommates I&rsquo;ve had. Thanks similarly to Ben Taylor &mdash; dude, we totally have to grab a pint now that I&rsquo;m in London. Thanks to Cody Torgerson for starting the Campus Greens and getting me involved on some level with the environmental movement in Calgary; also thanks for all the times we&rsquo;ve discussed technology over beers, it&rsquo;s always fun. Thanks to Chris Beauchamp, the hardest working man in the north Albertan creative media industry — in the bit over a decade I&rsquo;ve been developing websites, I&rsquo;ve worked with countless designers, and nobody comes even close to Chris&#8217; level of professionalism, comprehensiveness and style. The work he produces is seriously bad-ass. Speaking as an outsource web-developer who has done quite a lot of work with Chris, his designs are a joy to put into code. Beyond that, thanks for being the first editor I dealt with at the Gauntlet and doing so much to help me improve my writing back then. Thanks to Angela Larsen for the boilerplate contracts, for helping with photos at Motion Notion and for being there for Siyuan. The world would be a better place if everyone had such good friends. Thanks to Barnaby Bennett for being a totally rad dude and for getting me into so many shows. Pints are on me once you finally get your ass over here! Thanks to all the clients who gave me an opportunity to work on their website — particularly Fred Pattison, Karen Barry, Barry Blick, James Katalyst, Deekin at Quincy&rsquo;s, The Purple Pixie and all the people I&rsquo;ve done outsource work for. Thanks also to Tony Grimes (of Siteline Solutions, my other outsource partner) for giving me some interesting projects to work on, and for connecting me to the broader Calgary web-development community through Pixels &lsquo;n&rsquo; Pints. Another thanks to Fred Pattison for giving me an awesome employment opportunity all those years ago and more writing material than I&rsquo;ll ever know what to do with &mdash; really, much of what I&rsquo;ve done in the last few years is a direct result of having worked at the The Next Level. Thanks to the entire CJSW crew for always killing it around the clock, day after day, week after week. Big special thanks to Joe Burima for getting me involved with CJSW&rsquo;s web stuff in the first place, and also for writing me an awesome reference letter. Thanks to Paul Kennett for also writing me a reference &mdash; very much appreciated. Thanks to Mitch Bundy for being one of the most awesome technologists I&rsquo;ve met; Chad Saunders, Kat Dornian, Hayley Muir, Nathan Taylor and Marc Affeld for just being incredibly helpful and friendly &mdash; y&#8217;all rock. Thanks also to Lotus Queen and Tokyo Eyepatch for doing their thing and providing some much needed bass to the Calgary airwaves. I could go on; CJSW is one of the best things Calgary has going for it right now. While I&rsquo;m on CJSW people, thanks to Kat Lord for being one of the single most friendly people I&rsquo;ve met; I didn&rsquo;t really get a chance to talk to you or Charlotte given how crazy the going away party was, but I hope both of you are doing well in your new environments. Thanks also for setting that up, that was fun. Thanks to all the cool people who influenced me in some way at or via the Gauntlet (in no order): Emily Senger, Kyle Francis, Dale Miller, Kris Kotarski, Joelle Robichaud, Dan Pagan, Katy Anderson, Garth Paulson, Alan Cho, Jeff Kubik, Ben Li, Ryan Pike, Kate Foote, Jordyn Marcellus, Chris Tait, Cam Cotton-O&#8217;Brien, Remi Watts and Amy Badry, and my short-statured nemesis, Sarelle Azuelos. A few others come to mind: Amanda Hu, Paul Baker, Danny Kirk, Chris Pedersen and Noah Miller — y&#8217;all are cool too! Additionally, extra thanks to both Chris Beauchamp and Katy Anderson, who both always encouraged me to write news — I&rsquo;m probably much more competent at what I&rsquo;m doing now from that experience. Thanks to Sara Hanson and Wendy Pringle for being great roommates and for putting up with my shenanigans when I originally moved into 2816. Best of luck with whatever you&rsquo;ve got going right now. Thanks to Jasmin Frederickson for pushing me in some interesting directions and being an unusually chill person. Also for really being the first person I&rsquo;d met who was also into electronic music. Thanks to Deb Courchene for being the first person I really knew in Calgary — I might not have moved there in the first place had I not known you. Also, thanks for all the chats online while I was still in high-school; I&rsquo;m probably a more balanced person now having known at that time that there&rsquo;s intelligent life outside Moose Jaw. Thanks to Becky Schnurr-Howsam for all the chats; you always have a tendency of giving me good advice when I need it the most. Thanks to Keith Fagin for getting me involved with some interesting technology projects and for always fighting the good fight. Thanks to Marco Renda for giving me the opportunity to edit at my very first magazine and for caring deeply about a topic very few understand. Thanks to Katrina Mary Jade for letting me work on some cool projects — while I&rsquo;m not sure where those calendars will fit into my life&rsquo;s œuvre, I&rsquo;m glad to have had the opportunity to work on them. Thanks to everyone who worked on Hotbox with me; I know it didn&rsquo;t really pan out like we expected, but I certainly see value in the work we did. Thanks to all the teachers who made taking a Communications degree at the UofC worthwhile. Allison Dube, Ron Glasberg, Bart Beaty, Paul Kennett, Barry Cooper (I disagree with you on nearly everything you espouse, but I enjoyed your class regardless; the segment on Voegelin was fantastic.), Gwendolyn Blue, Brian Grant and, frankly, anybody who ever gave me an extension &mdash; most people on that list, actually. Thanks to my friends in and from Moose Jaw — Joel Kreutzwieser, Gordon Runn, Vince Langevin, Kurt and Trish Gillett, Tony Wong and the rest — for setting up our yearly LAN party and keeping that going as one of the things I know I can always look forward to every Christmas. Thanks to Steve Watkins for staying in contact while in Edmonton and being great to visit with. Thanks to my extended relatives &mdash; I know you generally have no clue why I do what I do, but I appreciate that you at least attempt to understand it. Thanks to Ishkur and everyone on the Ishboard, moot for 4chan, Kirtaner for 420chan — you&rsquo;ve all influenced me probably more than I&rsquo;d care to admit. Thanks to the Drupal, WordPress and Joomla! communities for all the free software and support — you&rsquo;ve paid my rent on many an occasion. Thanks to Kyle for setting up the Minecraft server I play on — it&rsquo;s one of the few collaborative, creative enterprises I have with people in Calgary, I really do appreciate the effort. Yeah, that&rsquo;s about it. If I forgot you, please respond angrily in the comments section and I&rsquo;ll address it as soon as possible! Thanks again! -Æ.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>A few friends and I have been spending an inordinate amount of time playing Minecraft on a server hosted by somebody I know. Given we&rsquo;re starting to get more than a few people logged on simultaneously (and because we have a few users now connecting from outside of Calgary — which will also be my case in a month or so, see next post.), a few of us felt it was important to upgrade the infrastructure to a [professionally-hosted collocated server](<a href="http://minehost.org">http://minehost.org</a>).

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p><em>Originally published in the Calgary Herald, Business section, page B1, July 7, 2011.</em> -&mdash;| When Gary Watson volunteered to allow Southern Alberta Institute of Technology students to scan his abdomen as part of a lab for the school&rsquo;s medical sonography program last year, little did he know they would uncover a ticking time bomb. &ldquo;I was absolutely floored,&rdquo; said Watson. &ldquo;Last time I was in the hospital, other than the occasional minor injury, was 60 years ago, when I was seven years old. &#8220;If anybody asked me how my health was, I&rsquo;d always say it was excellent. Nothing to lie awake about; no problems.&rdquo; Shortly into the scan, however, then-first year ultrasound program student Jill Schwarzenberger noticed a six-centimetre bulge in Watson&rsquo;s aortic artery. After informing the instructor, Watson was told to check with his family physician, who then confirmed the presence of the life-threatening aneurysm. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like having an old heater hose on a car swelling up in one spot and getting bigger and bigger,&rdquo; said Watson. &ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t gone in to get it done, I probably wouldn&rsquo;t be standing here talking to you.&rdquo; Watson was recently back at SAIT on the one-year anniversary of the screening to express his gratitude. For Schwarzenberger, who will graduate from the ultrasound program in December, it was exciting to have an opportunity to make a difference in somebody&rsquo;s health so early into her career. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very rewarding knowing that&rsquo;s going to be my job later on down the road, and knowing that I potentially helped save somebody&rsquo;s life. Aortic aneurysm is very deadly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;To be perfectly honest, I&rsquo;d thought I&rsquo;d done something wrong at the beginning; I didn&rsquo;t actually believe it was real. &#8220;Once I&rsquo;d gone over it a few times and realized it was real, I got Carrie to come over and explain to me what was going on.&rdquo; Diagnostic medical sonography instructor Carrie Hopkins said abdominal aortic aneurysms afflict about 15 per cent of the population and are difficult to detect due to the lack of symptoms. If such an aneurysm ruptures, the results are often fatal. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not completely rare, but the more we&rsquo;re doing screening and scanning, the more we&rsquo;re seeing them and being able to repair them so they don&rsquo;t become a lethal situation where (the patient) doesn&rsquo;t survive the surgery,&rdquo; Hopkins said. Meanwhile, Watkins has become a staunch advocate for early screening and detection, particularly for men over the age of 50. &ldquo;Just because you feel good doesn&rsquo;t mean you are good -I&rsquo;ve always felt healthy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Male or female over 50 years of age -talk to your doctor. &#8220;You should get one of these,&rdquo; he added. © Copyright &copy; The Calgary Herald.

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Confident in their new skills while venturing into an uncertain labour market, more than 400 Bow Valley College students celebrated graduation Monday. The school awarded professional diplomas and certificates to recipients in its Business, Health and Community Care and Academic Foundations programs. &ldquo;I feel ready and I feel confident,&rdquo; said Health &amp; Community Care valedictorian Danielle Janice Bravo. Bravo, an international student who received a practical nurse diploma, said she plans to work in Calgary as a licensed practical nurse, later returning to school to complete her nursing degree. &ldquo;I want to contribute back to the Calgary community,&rdquo; she told the Herald. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve well prepared me. Because of that, I feel very confident about getting into the workforce.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a sentiment shared by Business graduate Christie Corah. Corah, who received an Administrative Professional Certificate at the event, praised the school&rsquo;s work placement program. &ldquo;I am actually working right now at an oil and gas company downtown. I got the job two weeks before I finished my practicum at school, which happened so quickly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It definitely makes a student feel more prepared when they go into the real world, and it also gives them that bit more of experience, so they feel they know what they&rsquo;re doing when they start a real job.&rdquo; For Bow Valley College president and CEO Sharon Carry, the ceremonies are a proud moment for both students and staff. With a focus on work placement, Carry said at least 94 per cent of those graduating will find work in their field immediately. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s employers like to &lsquo;test drive&rsquo; new employees,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Because of our work experience component, employers have seen the great skills they bring into the workplace and are much more interested in employing folks they&rsquo;ve already reviewed and judged to be work-ready than they are resumes or people they&rsquo;ve never seen before.&rdquo; &ldquo;More than 90 per cent of our graduates stay in the city,&rdquo; Carry added. &ldquo;This really is a college that primarily serves Calgary and the surrounding region.&rdquo; © Copyright &copy; The Calgary Herald.

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p><em>Originally published in Calgary Herald, City &amp; Region section, page B9, June 23, 2011.</em> -&mdash;| Eyesight, for many, is something taken for granted until it is lost. In North America, the majority of blindness is caused naturally by old age. However, the situation in Africa is quite a different story. &ldquo;In Africa, we have eight million people who are blind, and maybe three times that many who are severely visually impaired,&rdquo; said Dr. Daniel Etya&#8217;ale, executive director of the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness. &ldquo;If you take that eight million, 80 per cent of those are blind from causes that can either be treated or prevented.&rdquo; Etya&#8217;ale, who spoke Wednesday at the annual meeting of Calgarybased Operation Eyesight Universal, is leading the charge in Africa against avoidable blindness. With 19 per cent of the world&rsquo;s blind population -many of whom are children -Africa represents the biggest challenge for Vision 2020. Vision 2020 is an ambitious set of goals put forth by the international agency and the World Health Organization intended to end avoidable blindness in the world by the year 2020. &ldquo;Avoidable blindness encompasses that 80 per cent, the things for which we can get ourselves excited, organize ourselves and try to eliminate as much as we can,&rdquo; said Etya&#8217;ale. Ranging from malnutrition to water-borne parasites to cataracts, Etya&#8217;ale estimated 70 per cent of blindness in children cannot only be prevented, but prevented by non-specialist physicians. The key, he said, is a combination of disease control, human resources and infrastructure. &ldquo;When you do the three together, you ensure nobody will go back frustrated because he or she has had training, but not the basic equipment to do what he or she has been trained to do,&rdquo; he said. Despite the dire situation, Etya&#8217;ale is optimistic. A burgeoning international focus on local solutions, driven more by community involvement than foreign aid, means that doctors make decisions and help in ways most relevant to those involved. &ldquo;The really inspirational thing is to realize that even in the most desperate areas, it is possible to do things,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I assure you, if you care to find out, there&rsquo;s a lot that is happening, of people doing things for themselves.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a sentiment echoed by Operation Eyesight Universal president and chief executive officer, Pat Ferguson. &ldquo;The solutions for some of the problems in developing countries lie in those developing countries,&rdquo; she said. &copy; Calgary Herald.

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Amateur and professional hockey players alike are taking to the streets today, as CBC Hockey Night In Canada&rsquo;s Play On! 4-on-4 street hockey tournament runs all weekend in the Deerfoot Outlet Mall&rsquo;s parking lot. &ldquo;This is kind of like their Super Bowl, all those guys who enjoy street hockey but don&rsquo;t have any place to play it,&rdquo; said Calgary event director Vern Gerhardt. &ldquo;The purpose of the tournament is to give street hockey a major league seal.&rdquo; Anywhere from 18,000 to 22,000 spectators are expected to watch. With 431 teams registered, the nearly 40 rinks at the Deerfoot Mall will hold almost 1,300 games. Started in 2002, the Calgary event is joined by 17 other cities, making it Canada&rsquo;s largest sports festival. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little bit of a smaller rink; ob-viously less players,&rdquo; said Gerhardt. &ldquo;We actually see a lot of players who come here who don&rsquo;t have ice hockey skills -you don&rsquo;t need to necessarily know how to skate in order to play this game.&rdquo; At 11: 45 a.m. today, Calgary Flames assistant coach Dave Lowry, Calgary Hitmen Nathan MacMaster and Brendan Santini, Hitmen alumnus Brandon Kozun and both University of Calgary Dinos teams will play a celebrity game. &copy; Calgary Herald.

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>CALGARY — A pothole brought a new headache to commuters heading northbound on Deerfoot Trail this morning. The pothole, in the left-hand lane on Deerfoot near where construction has begun on the Ogden Road overpass, brought traffic to a near halt. Crews later closed the left-hand lane as they applied a temporary fix to the hole. While a permanent repair is expected to close the lane for four hours starting at 11 p.m. tonight, crews are also shutting it down intermittently this afternoon as they monitor the temporary solution. The hole should be fixed in time for tomorrow’s commute, said Alberta Transportation spokesman Martin Dupuis. “An old pothole from six years ago just popped out today,” said Dupuis. “The patching is going to be done with concrete and will be fixed more permanently.” The pothole problem comes as the province continues work on the bridge deck over Ogden Road. The project — initially slated to begin in late May — was delayed by rain until the start of this month. Expected to last until early August, the construction on the expressway over Ogden Road will then be followed by additional construction on the Calf Robe bridge. © Copyright &copy; The Calgary Herald.

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>When University of Calgary geoscience professor Dr. Leslie Reid started teaching a decade ago, little did she know what the future had in store for her. The Tamaratt teaching professor and Project Engage team lead has spent the past five years helping other professors improve their courses and engage with students -things that have contributed to her being awarded a 3M National Teaching Fellowship today in Saskatoon. &ldquo;I actually feel very humbled by the whole process&hellip; . I kind of have this mindset that it&rsquo;s never good enough,&rdquo; said Reid. &ldquo;To have that punctuated with, &lsquo;Hey, what you&rsquo;ve been doing and working on and spending your time and energy on -we recognize that,&rsquo; it&rsquo;s pretty neat.&rdquo; Reid is one of 10 Canadian postsecondary professors receiving the award at the annual Society for Teaching and Learning in Higher Education conference. The event is being held this year in Saskatoon. Since 1986, the fellowships have sought to reward exceptional teaching and learning at Canadian universities. Reid received the U of C&rsquo;s Tamaratt Teaching Professorship in Geoscience in 2007. Since then, Reid has focused on improving the educational environment at the U of C for both students and professors alike. Helping profs evaluate and improve their teaching through initiatives such as the Evolve pilot project, Reid said the most important thing she&rsquo;s learned herself has been to take the time to listen to what students are saying. &ldquo;The greatest lesson I&rsquo;ve learned that has improved my teaching is to listen to students,&rdquo; Reid told the Herald. &ldquo;Sharing the responsibility, the power and the learning with students has allowed me to really use feedback in a meaningful way.&rdquo; In addition to receiving the award, Reid will join the other recipients in Banff this fall for a four-day educational retreat.</p>
