<div class="entry-content clearfix"><h3>From last week: + Section 4(2) &mdash; postponement order. Allows postpone publication of proceedings. Not forever. For avoiding a substantial risk of prejudice in administrating justice. + Section 39 &mdash; Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Wide-ranging order allowing courts to grant order preventing identification of anyone 17 or under involved in court proceedings, either criminal or civil. + Section 11 order &mdash; Allows court to withhold name of individual from public. I.e., in a blackmail case. + Common law and statutory qualified privilege &mdash; two different types of defences: 1. Defamation act (statutory) &mdash; public forums fairly and accurately reported are protected under qualified privilege. 2. Common law privilege &mdash; derived from judge-made law. Reynolds Defence. A matter of public interest, which has been reported responsibly, can be defended as such. +Article 2 &mdash; Right to Life. If someone’s life is at stake due to reporting, injunction can be put up against identification + If an injunction is being sought against a matter that touches upon a matter relating to freedom of speech, newspaper must be contacted and judge shouldn’t granted unless it felt applicant is going to win. + Rules on reporting in the youth court: reporters allowed, public is not. S49 of Children and Young Persons Act 1933 states that anyone 17 and below shouldn’t be identified (automatic ban). ## Privacy ### Other privacy legal issues + Data Protection Act 1998 + Journalistic exemption + §32 — data that is held for the purposes of journalism + Individual doesn’t have the right of access to find what info is held on him/her + Court shouldn’t grant injunctions prior to publication over individual data held + Unlawful procuring of information: Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 + Accessing private data without public permission can be a criminal offence. + Campbell v. MGN + If you’re asking someone to unlawfully obtain information on your behalf, that can also be a criminal offence. + Individual journalists/media agencies should be listed with the Information Commissioner. + Protection from Harassment Act 1997 + Criminal offence to pursue a course of conduct that can be considered harassment + Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 + Criminal offence to intercept communications without appropriate authority. ### Industry regulations surrounding privacy + PCC Code / Ofcom Broadcasting Code + Provision that individual’s privacy should not be breached a very important part of codes. + Privacy should not be breached unless it’s in the public interest + Not simply what’s interesting to the public. + Focused on public health/safety; prevent public from being misled; protect national security; something the public should know about + Specific issues: + Proportionality: is the breach that’s taking place proportionate to the wrongdoing being exposed? + Secret filming: can’t be a fishing expedition; needs to have prima facie evidence. + Public figures: politicians and others who have spent their life putting it into the public domain, less right than average person. + Public domain: Similar to the above? + Methodology: act respectfully and responsibly; put yourself in the position of who you’re filming. + Areas of privacy: + People in distress + Each individual case on its own merit; getting a sense of what’s going on is okay, but tight focus on person’s face is not. + Intimate details + Health matters + Going into individual’s condition (esp. pregnancy before 12 weeks) on wrong side. + Revisiting past events + Children — heightened regulation to protect children, shouldn’t be questioned about private matters except in loco parentis + Door-stepping — Justified in on-the-day stories of public interest. Not normally for investigative reporting unless individual contacted beforehand and asked for a response. If response not given, might be justified to door-step. + Suicide — number of regulations to respect families and prevent copycats. Not allowed to be very in-depth. Photo of individual about to jump from bridge or window not allowed. + Daily Sport “suicide hotspots” story &mdash; PCC ruled unacceptable, gave too much detail and encouraged copycats. + Locations + Key test: “A reasonable expectation of privacy” + Can be even in a public place + Churches + Paul McCartney praying after death of wife; Hallo in 1998. PCC ruled on McCartney’s side. + Beaches + Daily Mail article in 2000 about Anna Ford on public beach in swimwear. + PCC ruled on side of news media; Ford appealed, ruling upheld. + Anna Macpherson with children &mdash; unacceptable (esp. because on private beach) + An address of a celebrity + Not acceptable to identify location of individual’s house. + Daniel Craigg and Miz Dynamite made complaints; deemed to be on wrong side of the line. + Funerals + Carol Smiley at mother’s funeral — deemed unacceptable to film + Filming with police + No right to film in private house with police + Filming arrest or police operation, would have to pixelate individuals arrested. + Methodology for gaining private information + Filming in public places + If visible to naked eye in a public place, it’s probably acceptable. + Careful: shopping centres; royal parks; buses open to public but not public places. + Long range lenses: care must be used. + 2002 &mdash; Julie Goodyear complained about photographs of her sitting in back garden via long lens. Considered breach, wouldn’t have been visible without lens and not in public interest. + Secret filming + Forms normally have to be filled out justifying filming. + Harassment + Not allowed! Next week: copyright. Last one before Easter Break! Go through everything in syllabus before class returns after break!</h3>
