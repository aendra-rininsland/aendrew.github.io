<div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Answers from last week: + What is the watershed? + 9 p.m. to 5 a.m., more adult content is allowed. Not allowed outside of that span in order to protect young persons. + Doesn&rsquo;t change instantly; more adult the later in the evening. + Issues on payments to criminals? + Journalists should not be making payments to criminals unless there is a clear public interest. (PCC and Ofcom.) + Police Bail + The outcome of an individual being taken to the police station is threefold: release without charge, held on charge, or released on police bail. + I.e., the police are still making enquiries and may call you back. + &ldquo;Without prejudice communication&rdquo; &mdash; Open conversation between lawyers, but does not effect the outcome of a case. + Spycatcher principle &mdash; if an injunction or court order applies to one paper, it applies to all of them. Next week: + What are the rules of the PCC about journalists seeking interviews at hospitals? + In Copyright Law, what is the difference between an assignment and a copyright license? + Name three ways journalists can be subject to the criminal law in finding information. + If appealing from the magistrate&rsquo;s court on a point of law and a point of fact, where does the appeal go? + What court does a Lord Justice sit in? + How does the PCC define the public interest? + Are there any rules concerning reporting celebrities becoming pregnant? This week&rsquo;s media law issues: 1. Search &ldquo;secret courts&rdquo; &mdash; ongoing issue in legislation re: new rules brought in by MoJ making some courts easier to be heard in closed session. 1. Case in ECHR &mdash; Tussalp v. Turkey &mdash; two defamation actions against PM against journalist. Court came down on side of journalist: &ldquo;Turkish courts had not set the remarks within a proper context and the form in which they were conveyed.&rdquo; Rules remarks were lawful. &ldquo;Turkish courts had failed to establish any pressing need for establishing PM&rsquo;s rights above freedom of expression.&rdquo; #Privacy ## Cases + Personal relationships + Stephens v Avery + Confidential information + Creation Records v News Group Newspapers (1997) + Court allowed injunction preventing publishing of Sun photo about Oasis photoshoot due to confidentiality attached to shoot. + Employment relationships + An employee owes a duty of confidentiality to employer. + An employer is entitled to rely on an employee remaining confidential. + Brisco v. Brisco + Nightjack case &mdash; court ruled it was in the public interest in blogger&rsquo;s identity (in this case, a night police officer) to be disclosed. # Defences + Iniquity + &ldquo;Something which is immoral, unrighteous, etc.&rdquo; + If there is information that is confidential but exposes wrongdoing, may be used as a defence. + Lions Laboratories v. Evans + Story arguing breathalyzer ineffective via documents from former employee. + Lion Laboratories argued employee took information they wouldn&rsquo;t have access to; should be considered confidential and not published. + Cook v. McVicker (1984) + Reporter surreptitiously recorded off-the-record conversation about police corruption; reporter decided to publish and with attribution. + Reporter successfully argued it would be in the public interest to reveal such information. + Viagogo v. Channel 4 (2012) + Investigative report re: online ticketing. Sought injunction to prevent airing of report. Confidentiality agreement signed at Viagogo, argued information obtained unlawfully. + Clear public interest in correcting the false image Viagogo put forward. &ldquo;Balancing exercise favoured the defendant.&rdquo; + Person has courted publicity + Woodward v. Hutchins (1977) + Tom Jones (Woodward) tried to stop a former agent from disclosing information about Jones&#8217; private life. + Hutchins&#8217; case was that Jones had put his life so far into the public domain was that it wouldn&rsquo;t be right for court to impose injunction. + Beckhams v. Nanny (2005) + Nanny wanted to publish about arguments between the Beckhams; court decided that she should be able to. + Public interest + Public domain + If the information is so widely circulated, it would be futile and ridiculous to impose an injunction to prevent it from being published. + Limitations: + Tony Blair v. Mail on Sunday &mdash; Nanny wanted to publish re: Blairs&#8217; home life. Court ruled injunction for the second edition of the paper, even though published in first. + Confidentiality / privacy + Limits of confidentiality: Kaye v. Robertson (1991) + If no duty of confidentiality, argument doesn&rsquo;t work. + In 1991, an actor (Kaye) was driving when scaffolding collapsed, injuring him. Taken to hospital and suffering extensive surgery. + While there, reporters from Sunday Sport went into his room, photographed him and interviewed him. Went to Court of Appeal; confidential setting; court focused on relationship between Kaye and photographer. + No duty owed between Kaye and the photographer. No law of privacy and the law of confidentiality different. + Human Rights Act (1998) Art. 8 sets out privacy as a human right; creates a law of privacy. + Article 8 v. Article 10 (Freedom of Expression) &mdash; balancing act. + Law was introduced within statute then developed through the common law. Judges allowed to develop the law at will; politicians really should have created an Act outlining everything. + ยง12 and injunctions &mdash; if the person against whom an injunction is directed is not in court, court should not grant injunction. + No relief should be granted before publishing unless it can be established claimant is highly likely to establish facts are wrong afterwards. + Photographs &mdash; greater impact/protection + Privacy in a public place &mdash; media entitled to film in a public place. + Peck case &mdash; Man with knife about to commit suicide but apprehended was filmed; British court argued he was in a public place, ECHR said authorities had not upheld his privacy. + Reasonable expectation of privacy + Depends on circumstances, but parameters have been extended significantly over time. + In restaurant, in someone else&rsquo;s house, etc. reasonable expectation of privacy. + Children + Not allowed to be filmed; JK Rowling got injunction against anyone filming her children. + Location + Cases often determined on the facts. + &ldquo;Intense focus&rdquo;</p>
