<div class="entry-content clearfix"><h2>For exam + 30 multi-choice questions; + Know the names and intent of provisions; know case names. ## Important cases + Flood v. Times Newspapers Ltd. (2011) &mdash; Supreme Court + Upholds and restates the Reynolds Defence. + Article allegations that a British security company with wealthy Russian clients paid for sensitive information about extraditions + Subject to a libel complaint from police officer named. Flood was exonerated, so was pressing for libel. + Judges came down on side of the Times; argued it was in the public interest for story to be published. + &ldquo;Story told was high public interest&rdquo; &mdash; argued if Flood were not named, other members of the extradition unit would come under public scrutiny. # Copyright Law + Purpose + Designed to ensure those who create copyright works — photographs, film footage, books, etc. — are rewarded for their labours. + Incentivizes creative work. + Tangible form + No copyright in ideas — has to be created before it gets copyright. + No copyright in facts + Hughie Green v. NZ Broadcasting (1989) — elements of original programming in a knockoff in New Zealand. &ldquo;Nobody owns the rights to a talent contest.&rdquo; + Norowozian v. Arks (1999) — A Guinness advert using a technique (&ldquo;jump cutting&rdquo;) and dance style was similar to that used in the plaintiff&rsquo;s film. Court ruled nobody owns a dance style or film technique. + Physical ownership v copyright + Approached as a property right (Specifically intellectual property) + If you receive a letter, copyright rests with the letter writer — not the receiver. + Copyrights in a news report + No need for a registration + You don&rsquo;t have to register work to have a copyright on something. No &ldquo;copyright register&rdquo;. Work automatically gains protection, even without the © + Breach — substantial use + &ldquo;What is worth copying is worth protecting&rdquo; — principle ## Who owns it? + Author &mdash; if you&rsquo;re independent, then you own the copyright. + Employees &mdash; if you&rsquo;re employed by someone, then it&rsquo;s your employer who owns the copyright. + Freelancers &mdash; you generally own the copyright; newspapers now generally have a provision allowing reproduction of a piece bought from a freelancer online, etc. + Robin Ray v. Classic FM (1998) &mdash; asked to create an internal system for classifying music work. Radio station then tried to sell system to others; court ruled Classic FM wasn&rsquo;t allowed to sell Ray&rsquo;s work without permission. + Assignment &mdash; Who owns the copyright? + License &mdash; What is the breadth of the license? Single use, only on TV, on the Internet, both? For a time length or Into perpetuity? Where is this usage allowed? ## Length of copyright + Creative works: 70 years from end of year author died + If author unknown, 70 years from end of year of publication + Sound recordings / broadcast: 50 years from end of year of first publication + If it involves, say, a song with lyrics, the lyrics will be copyrighted as per the above (I.e., 70 years). ## Legal events + §30 CopyrighT Designs and Patents Act 1988 + &ldquo;Fair dealing&rdquo; provision places reporting current events about the interest of a copyright owner. + &ldquo;Fair dealing with a work other than a photograph for the purpose of reporting events does not infringe any copyright in the work, so long as it is accompanied by a sufficient acknowledgment.&rdquo; + What is fair? + Simply lifting content isn&rsquo;t fair; not giving a credit isn&rsquo;t fair. + Using material as wallpaper isn&rsquo;t fair. + Time Warner Co V. Channel Four Television (1994) + Over 80% of Clockwork Orange was shown in a programme on Channel 4; court ruled in favour of Channel 4 despite lack of permission. + Pro Seiben v. Carlton UK TV (1999) + Carlton UK TV was doing programme on chequebook journalism and used clip from Pro Seiben exclusive; ruled on side of Carlton. + Exclusivity + Less likely to be fair is just used to &ldquo;yank rug out&rdquo; from under a competitor. + Motive + Informational + Restrictions + Credit + Does not apply to stills. + Fair dealing for criticism, review + Public interest defence? + Paddy Ashdown v. Telegraph — Telegraph had published snippet from plaintiff&rsquo;s unpublished autobiography; court ruled there was a public interest due to it soon coming out. + Damages — market rate/aggravated + Paid in terms of market rate; more in aggravated circumstances (photo stolen) + Release forms — important; allows you to use their footage forevermore. + Sports footage — if showing footage, normally able to use 60 seconds with credit. If a series of matches (I.e., World Cup or something), increases to 90 seconds. + Internet — copyright applies as much as anywhere else. If using someone else&rsquo;s photo, you have to seek permission. + § 58 Copyright and Design Act + If someone giving a speech, you&rsquo;re generally allowed to report it without permission.</h2>
