<div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Questions from last week: + Talking to people in hospital? + Must identify as a journalist and get permission from hospital authorities. + What&rsquo;s the difference between an assignment in copyright law and license + Assignment: complete transfer from A to B. + License: permission being granted to use a copyrighted work for a certain purpose. + Where would you go on appeal of fact from the Magistrate&rsquo;s Court? + Appeal would lie to the Crown Court. + On matters of law, i.e., an adjudication on a law, matter is appealed to the Divisional court of the High Court. + What court would a Lord Justice sit in? + Court of Appeal + Public interest: a defined concept within the industry regulators + What are the rules regarding reporting pregnancy? + Within PCC, shouldn&rsquo;t refer to an individual&rsquo;s pregnancy up to 12 weeks, unless that information&rsquo;s already in the public domain. + Adjudications: Danny Minogue, Charlotte Church ## For next week: + What are these orders and when are appropriate? + §4(2) order + §39 order + §11 order + What&rsquo;s the difference between commonlaw qualified privilege and statutory qualified privilege? + In the ECHR, what does article 2 protect; what does §12(3) of the Human Rights Act say about injunctions? + What are the rules about reporting court cases that take place in the Youth Court? ### This week in law + PCC is no more! Will be replaced by&hellip; something. + Jeffries case: Mirror and Sun were prosecuted for contempt; Mirror sought appeal and was turned down # Confidentiality/Privacy ## Major cases + Douglas v. Hallo (2000) + Wedding between Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas. Had sold rights to Ok magazine; rival Hallo had photographer who surreptitiously took photos as part of wedding party. Douglases sued for breach of confidence; court upheld the right of the Douglases to protect their wedding. Court argued law of privacy would uphold law of confidentiality; duty of confidentiality didn&rsquo;t need to be identified. Setting was private, info had a commercial value &mdash; injunction would be granted. + Theakston v. MGN Ltd (2002): photographs + TV star visited brothel; story was told about exploits. Injunction sought, not granted about an account of what happened, though injunction granted against photographs being published. + &ldquo;Photographs can be particularly intrusive, particularly if not done with consent.&rdquo; + Peck v. UK (2003): privacy in a public place + Person tried to commit suicide, picture being prevented given to media, ECHR came down on his side and the council had acted inappropriately in providing photos to media. + Princess Caroline von Hannover v. Germany (2004) + Argued pictures taken of her were not of public interest and she was being harassed. ECHR came down on Princess Caroline von Hannover&rsquo;s side. + Naomi Campbell v. MGN Ltd (2004) (**the** major case re: privacy) + Campbell sued over report in Daily Mirror talking about her treatments for drug addiction. Report showed a photo of her leaving therapy session and gave details about therapy; frequency of therapy. Went to House of Lords, which came down 3-2 in favour of Campbell saying it was acceptable to publish details of drug treatment and to say she had a drug problem, but not acceptable to say she was going to Narcotics Anonymous, or where the treatment, or the kind of treatment; also, unacceptable to show photos of her leaving Narcotics Anonymous. Termed &ldquo;Wrongful disclosure of private information&rdquo;. Looks at the following: a. Is it private information? b. If disclosure took place, would it cause substantial offence to a reasonable person? c. What are the benefits of disclosure? d. Where does the public interest lie? + Lady Justice Hale: distinction being made between coming out from treatment or going about their normal business. + McKennitt v. Ash (2005) + Brought privacy to another level; a Canadian singer (Lorraine McKennitt) had book written about her by friend. Discussed things only a friend would be aware of. + Court sided with McKennitt; argued she was entitled to protect this information and friend didn&rsquo;t have right to publish it. In judgement itself, not made clear what was true or not; court said it wasn&rsquo;t for the claimant to sift through information to discriminate against what is true or not as that would undermine privacy further. + Murray v. Big Pictures (2008) + JK Rowling followed around Edinburgh with child in a pram; injunction sought to prevent photographs to pursue her. + Court granted, arguing special protection granted to children. + Max Mosley v. News Group Newspapers Ltd (2008) + Sued over NOTW articles suggesting he had been involved in Nazi-themed sex parties. + Judge came down arguing on the facts that there wasn&rsquo;t evidence the party was Nazi themed. If it was, there would be public interest. + Mosley then argued to the ECHR he should be aware of articles coming out about him, but ECHR argued he didn&rsquo;t have a right to be able to step in an attempt to stop publication. No right for claimant to be told about matter relating to privacy prior to publication. + LNS v. Persons Unknown (2010) + Footballer (John Terry) tried to create a blanket injunction about an affair. Came down against Terry, arguing he was doing this only to protect commercial interests. + Super injunctions + Trafigura v. Guardian Newspapers + Guardian had info re: Trafigura&rsquo;s toxic waste. Court imposed injunction on publication, but also on publication of information about injunction. + MP argued there shouldn&rsquo;t be a superinjunction; injunction unraveled and information because public. + Ferdinand v. MGN Ltd (2011) + Rio brought a case against Mirror; Mirror had published details about an affair. Judge Nichol came down on side of newspaper. + Ferdinand was the head of English football team; had tried to establish reputation as a reformed character (even having written an autobiography); lady had a right to tell story. + Spelman v. Express Newspapers Ltd + Newspaper got paper about rugby player (son of MP) had been ordering illegal performance enhancing drugs. Injunction initially granted then revoked; argued info was in the public domain. + Princess Caroline von Hannover (2012) + Case showed her and her family walking through the streets of Monaco with father, Prince Rainier, who had been ill. Law came down on side of press, arguing showing a reigning monarch in recovery was in the public interest. + Human Rights Act §12(3) + No injunction should be granted unless applicant is likely to win its case. + Media has to be given notice of applicantions + Much lower test than in libel (I.e., Bonnard v. Perryman), where it would be granted only if applicant is able to establish the falsity of the claims. # The Right to Life + Article 2 &mdash; Everyone&rsquo;s right to life should be protected by law. Everyone&rsquo;s life should be protected by the law, except in the case of capital punishment. + An absolute right; not a qualified right in the sense it isn&rsquo;t balanced with another right. &ldquo;Trumps all.&rdquo; + Venables and Thompson v. News Group Newspapers Ltd (2001) + Two youths found guilty in murder of a young boy. Question was if identifiable after release; court was asked to prevent injunction after they reach age of majority in order to protect right to life. Courts came down in favour of individuals; Art. 2 allowed courts to grant injunction preventing identification ever. + Maxine Carr v. News Group Newspapers Ltd (2004) + Involved with a murder case in that she gave a false alibi for her boyfriend. Was granted injunction to prevent her from being identified given she was being sent death threats.</p>
